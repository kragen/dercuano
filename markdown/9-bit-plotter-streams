Suppose we’re in an alternate history where Japan won WWII due to some
grievous miscalculations by the US.  Computer technology developed
anyway, somewhat later, on 18-bit machines like the PDP-4, PDP-7, and
PDP-9, with 9-bit bytes, accommodating potentially a 512-bit character
set — not enough for single-character kanji, but plenty for hiragana,
katakana, and some common kanji.  The electromechanical output device
of choice in 1970 is not a teletype, but a kind of pen plotter
optimized for curve plotting, with a scotophor CRT memory tube (like a
Skiatron) as a higher-speed and less material-consuming alternative.

Instead of having two motors driving a teletype carriage across the
paper, a third motor to select a letter from a typewheel, and a
solenoid to fire a type hammer, the plotter has a pen-down solenoid
and X and Y motors (counting from the upper right corner of the page)
servoed from, nominally, analog voltage signals with a SNR of some
26dB, providing an effective resolution on the paper of some
2000×2000.  These position signals are controlled in two ways: by
setting them directly from a 12-bit DAC and by being changed over time
by a velocity signal, which is also nominally an analog voltage signal
with a 26dB SNR; it, too, can be set directly from a 12-bit DAC, but
is changed over time by a (26 dB SNR) acceleration signal, which is an
analog voltage signal that can only be set directly or zeroed by a
reset command.  This allows the plotter to plot perfectly smooth
curves by setting only the acceleration signal periodically as the
motors move under servo control.

There is additionally a “form feed” command, which initiates a change
of page, either through manual operator intervention or through an
automatic motor mechanism.  The scotophor tube implements this by
erasing the image.

This gives us 10 basic commands: x←, y←, x'←, y'←, x"←, y"←, reset,
form feed, pen up, and pen down.  Additionally, there’s an 11th
command, which idles the command stream for the given amount of time
to allow the pen to catch up.  The basic plotter command word, then,
is an 18-bit word consisting of a 4-bit order code field, a 12-bit
operand field, and two extra bits.

The “reset” command sets the velocity and acceleration to 0, but
doesn’t change the position.

In our timeline, the 1981 CGA had 128 kilobits of framebuffer; the
US$1200 1976 ADM-3A had 16 kilobits of ASCII screen contents buffer
(not even inverse video!).  We’re supposing that this plotter thing
became standardized in 1965 at a budget of about US$50000, in a
timeline where Moore’s Law’s 18-month capacity doubling was about five
years behind our own.  In our timeline, the appropriate amount of
memory for computer terminal equipment was about one bit per 7.5¢
(total cost of the equipment, not the cost of the memory) in 1976,
which would be 1981 in the Japan plotter timeline.  So 1965 would be
16 years back from that, roughly 10 capacity doublings back: US$75.00
per bit.  So the plotter has a digital memory budget of about 32 of
these 18-bit words, or 64 9-bit bytes.

A terrible problem for terminal equipment at the time was that speeds
of 10 characters per second were demanded (this was the major upgrade
in the Teletype Model 28, introduced in our timeline in 1953, and a
widely used computer console until about 1970 in our timeline; the
Friden Flexowriter used as the console for the LGP-30 was also 10
6-bit characters per second) but it was challenging to transmit data
over long distances at more than 300 bits per second.  Much of Unix’s
user interface design (for example, the absence of success messages,
the two-letter command names, and the "?" error message from ed, The
Standard Editor) derives from this.  We can suppose that the Japanese
would be satisfied with 5 characters per second, but instructing the
plotter to draw a single character like “ア”, “ラ”, “マ”, or “ハ”
involves about four or five vertices per character, and each vertex
requires typically a new x/y position, perhaps a new x'/y' velocity,
and often pen up or down.  This means we need three or four commands
for each vertex, and maybe 16 such commands per character, totaling
288 bits — almost an entire second to transmit in full!

There are about two strokes and two non-plotting movements per
character, so the plotter pen also needs to be able to move the
distance of a typical character stroke 20 times per second, or 50
milliseconds.  If the character box is 5 mm square, and the typical
stroke length is about half of that or 3 mm, we need a 60 mm/s pen
movement speed, which seems rather slow; we can probably specify
240 mm/s, giving us the physical ability to plot some 20 katakana
characters per second, rather than only 5, for which we would also
need to be able to execute 320 commands per second.  If we presume
that our paper is shiroku-ban size 4, 264 mm × 379 mm (implying ≈200μm
servo resolution), it will take us an entire second to move from one
side of the paper to the other, and the paper can hold 52 columns of
75 characters, which will take some 195 seconds to finish plotting,
which is an entirely reasonable kind of interval for a human operator
to be asked to manually change the paper.  (If we analyze a
hypothetical analog electronic PID control system for controlling the
pen position with a mechanical system whose acceleration is low-pass
filtered by its mechanics, we can derive the kinds of glitchy
distortions likely to result in the characters.)

If we figure that a typical stroke length is 3 mm at 240 mm/s, the pen
needs 12.5 milliseconds to execute it, so millisecond resolution is
likely adequate for the “delay” command; to be safe, let’s say we
count cycles of a 8kHz clock, so the maximum delay with a 12-bit
operand is about half a second.  Of course, later plotters that manage
higher speeds, and the CRT version, will virtualize these
“milliseconds”.

(What should the scale for the v and a components be?  Like, how many
virtual milliseconds should x'=1 take to increment x by 1?)

We have a relatively large discrepancy here between the hypothetical
mechanical device’s physical capabilities to execute 320 commands per
second and the hypothetical serial link’s physical capability of 300
*bits* per second.  In the other direction, in our timeline, the
(18-bit!)  1959 PDP-1 could execute about 93,000 instructions per
second, and presumably a similar stack-based machine could execute
about 200,000 instructions per second, or maybe 20,000 if it were much
smaller and therefore less powerful than the PDP-1’s 2700 transistors,
3000 diodes, and 4096 18-bit words of core.

Could we advantageously use this powerful memory of 64 9-bit bytes or
32 18-bit words, or maybe a few times that, and the potential of
executing tens or hundreds of thousands of instructions per second, to
bridge the gap between the 300-bit-per-second serial link and the 320
drawing operations per second.  Maybe you could even take full
advantage of the curve-drawing abilities of the hardware with a font
ROM made with PCB inductance, like the HP 9100A’s microcode PCB (512
64-bit words totaling 32 kibibits, 1968 in our timeline, US$5000, 23
registers of core RAM; projecting forwards to 1973, backwards 8 years
to 1965 to get a factor of 6 Moore’s Law reduction, and up by a factor
of 10 to account for the larger budget, we get 53 kibibits), or core
ropes, like the Apollo AGC (1966 in our timeline, astronomical
budget).

The GreenArrays C18 core has (not counting its stacks) 128 18-bit
cells in its memory address space, of which 64 18-bit cells are RAM
and 64 18-bit cells are ROM; disregarding literal cells, each one
normally has four five-bit instructions packed into it, with the
fourth instruction having two implicit zero bits.  This is only a
factor of two greater than the RAM budget of 32 18-bit cells I
suggested above, and although it is somewhat limited in what you can
achieve on a single core, I think a smaller C18-like processor would
work fine as a controller for this hypothetical plotter.  Normally it
would execute 18-bit instruction words received over its serial port,
which could read and write its 64 cells of RAM, and also make calls to
routines loaded into its RAM and routines already present in its ROM;
if it can execute 20 000 instructions per second, then it has time to
execute some 63 processor instructions per necessary plotter
instruction or 1000 processor instructions per plotter stroke, and if
our serial connection gives us a start bit, 9 data bits, and a stop
bit per 9-bit byte, at 300bps we can receive 27 bytes per second and
execute 733 processor instructions per serial byte.  Two such bytes
should be adequate to invoke a subroutine to draw a character.

This architecture would actually allow font ROMs with a significant
number of kanji, since you could define and invoke subroutines for
radicals with bounding-box parameters.

Of course, this approach also allows you to write characters at
arbitrary non-character-cell positions, to draw arbitrary line
graphics, and probably to draw stipple patterns.

(If the pen is replaced by a brush, it might make sense to use a
proportional actuator like a servomotor or voice coil to control trace
intensity, which of course is easy on a scotophor.)

The physical system described here visits new points at about 20 Hz,
which means it probably needs to have its first vibrational eigenmode
well above 200 Hz to avoid unacceptable ringing (with a simple PID
control system, anyway.)

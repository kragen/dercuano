Alphanumerenglish
=================

Arabic has some phonemes that don’t have a reasonable corresponding
phoneme in Latin languages.  A common approach when writing Arabic
with Latin letters is to use European digits for the missing phonemes,
as in “3arabawy”.  This has the great advantage over X-SAMPA that it
doesn’t deprive you of the uppercase/lowercase distinction
entirely — although the digits themselves, in ASCII, don’t show the
distinction visibly, you can still distinguish between “3arabawy” and
“3ARABAWY”, or between “a7a”, “A7a”, and “A7A”.  The European digits
are assigned to sounds represented by Arabic letters that physically
resemble them.

This seems like a great idea for English, too!  English has a few more
phonemes than the Latin alphabet, and consequently has to force some
letters to represent multiple different phonemes, but its traditional
orthography worsens the problem by wasting some of the Latin letters
(c, q, and x) on redundant assignments.  A rough phonological
inventory of English follows, with a corresponding set of alphanumeric
codes.

In a few cases, I’ve taken the liberty of giving a diphthong a
spelling that isn’t quite what you’d deduce logically, in the interest
of making it easier to write: /oʊ/ is “o” rather than “o5” or “ou”,
because I think /o/ doesn’t occur in outside of that diphthong in
English, and likewise /eɪ/ is assigned a single digit “8”; /æʊ/ is
“au” rather than “4u” or “45”, because although [au] is not the
central instance of the /æʊ/ class, it’s certainly a valid
pronunciation of it; and /aɪ/ is “ai” rather than “a1” for the same
reason.

The mnemonics for the digits and other nonstandard pronunciations are
as follows:

    | 0 | ɔ  | looks like an O                             |
    | 1 | ɪ  | looks like an I                             |
    | 2 | ɑ  | no clue, sorry                              |
    | 3 | ɛ  | looks like an ɛ, backwards                  |
    | 4 | æ  | looks like an A                             |
    | 5 | ʊ  | no clue, sorry                              |
    | 6 | ŋ  | looks like the G in NG                      |
    | 7 | ʌ  | looks like ʌ tilted a bit                   |
    | 8 | eɪ | 8 is pronounced /eɪt/ in English            |
    | c | tʃ | “c” is pronounced like standard “ch”        |
    | e | ə  | looks like ə; also, the most common vowel   |
    | q | ð  | no clue, and this one is super weird, sorry |
    | x | θ  | no fucking clue, sorry                      |

In the interest of ease of typing and reading, I’ve tried to assign
the less common sounds to digits, and especially digits that don’t
look like anything.  You might be able to get some benefit from
swizzling around the assignment of 2 and 5, and maybe x and q too.

You might also get a readability improvement out of reassigning /ə/ to
"a" rather than “e”, which would leave “e” free for /ɛ/, but would
require reassigning /a/ to something else, such as “9” or “3”.  /a/
alone is relatively rare in English, but “ai” and “au” are relatively
common.

I’ve written a short Python hack to use eSpeak to convert traditional
English orthography to Alphanumerenglish, not perfectly but with a
tolerably low error rate.  It turns out Alphanumerenglish is about 10%
shorter.

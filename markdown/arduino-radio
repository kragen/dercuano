The Arduino’s PWM output can output at up to 31.25kHz with 256 levels,
because the counter increments at 8MHz.  You can get a 4MHz square
wave out of that counter, but maybe more interestingly, that square
wave has harmonics at 12MHz, 20MHz, 28MHz, and so on.  You should be
able to amplify the original signal with a transistor or two and
filter out the higher harmonics as a way to generate an RF signal.
Maybe even more interesting, if you change the cycle length and duty
cycle, you can generate different harmonics.

Now, if you want to generate an FM signal, it’s going to be a little
bit tricky; you need a harmonic in the range of 87.5 to 108 MHz, which
is not impossible, but the tricky part is that the peak deviation is
75kHz, which is a bit under 0.1% of the frequency.  So you need some
way to somewhat reliably vary the frequency you’re generating by
quantities less than 0.003%.  Maybe you can do this using the AVR’s
external RC oscillator on the Xtal1 pin with a varactor to adjust the
clock frequency of the whole chip a bit.

However, an AM signal should be a lot easier.  This is in the 540 kHz
to 1610 kHz range, and the Arduino is capable of generating these
signals more or less directly; 1600 kHz, 1333 kHz, 1142 kHz, 1000 kHz,
888 kHz, 800 kHz, 727 kHz, 666 kHz, 615 kHz, and 571 kHz are all
available subharmonics of the 8MHz timebase, and if you want to use
the third harmonic of a frequency that’s three times lower, you could
very easily get three times as many stations; but that isn’t necessary
and probably creates more filtering headaches than it’s worth.

In the middle of this range, at 800 kHz, you have 10 bits available.
If you stick to pure PWM modulation, you then have 10 power levels
available for each oscillation, but that’s measuring from DC; you
really only have 5.  But if you’re transmitting a max-5kHz audio
signal, which is all AM radio receivers can really handle, your
Nyquist frequency is 10ksps, so you have 80 oscillations available per
“sample” to dither with.  This means you really have more like 400
amplitudes to play with — almost 9 bits, 54 dB SNR — and more at lower
frequencies.  So you should be able to transmit a perfectly
respectable-sounding AM signal.

If you simply adjust the PWM threshold between, say, 5 and 10, with a
repetition time of 10 cycles, to adjust the amplitude of the 800 kHz
signal, you will introduce a “DC” bias as well, which will vary with
the amplitude.  If this is undesired, you might want to alternate
between >50% and <50% duty cycle at some frequency, but doing this
without going out of phase may be tricky.

The dithering will produce subharmonic distortion, but if the dither
changes levels relatively infrequently, most of the subharmonic can be
down in the near-audio range.  For example, if you adjust the PWM
limit by 1 at irregular intervals averaging 40000 times per second, I
think nearly all of the dithering noise will be in the 20kHz to 60kHz
range.  And you’ll only need to service a timing interrupt once every
200 cycles, making it feasible to do other things at the same time.

A small magnetic loop antenna, maybe one stolen from an AM radio
receiver, is probably the best way to do the coupling to the air.

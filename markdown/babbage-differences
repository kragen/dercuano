On the method of finite differences used in Babbage’s Difference Engine
=======================================================================

The “method of finite differences” as used in the Difference Engine is
closely related to, but slightly different from, Newton’s [method of
divided differences][0] (used, for example, for polynomial
interpolation or for boundary-value problems in ordinary differential
equations) and the [finite difference method][1] used in the solution
of ODEs and PDEs.

The [Wikipedia page on the Difference Engine explains][2] how to
calculate the initial values, but I am skeptical of its explanation.
However, it cites [Nathan Myhrvold’s instructions for setting up the
machine][4], which we can suppose have been tested on the one he had
built.

Reading [F. Baily’s 1823 comments on the Difference Engine][3] we
find:

The table of cubes begins 1, 8, 27, 64, 125; its first differences are
7, 19, 37, 61…, and its second differences are thus 12, 18, 24…, its
third differences 6, 6…, and its fourth differences merely a sequence
of zeroes, since the third-order approximation is actually precisely
correct.  The first item of each of these sequences gives the (1, 7,
6, 6) setup described in Baily’s article.

XXX no it doesn’t; 6 is the difference between 1 and 7, so I think Baily
actually took into account the half-cycle offset I claim below that he
didn’t take into account; his numbers give the correct answer as shown
at the end.

However, to update this state (1, 7, 6, 6) to its successor state (8,
13, 12, 6) without any extra storage, we must work strictly from left
to right, because the previous value of each number (except the 1, in
the lowest-order register, T) is needed to update the next-lower-order
term, before being itself updated (except the second 6, in the
highest-order register, Δ³).  So we must proceed as follows:

    | T | Δ¹ | Δ² | Δ³ |
    | 1 |  7 |  6 |  6 |
    | 8 |  7 |  6 |  6 |
    | 8 | 13 |  6 |  6 |
    | 8 | 13 | 12 |  6 |

XXX note that 13 is wrong because it should be 19

However, at least in the “Difference Engine No. 2” design Babbage
developed between 1846 and 1849 (23–26 years after Baily’s letter),
the calculations are not performed in this serial fashion.  [As
explained in Swade’s analysis][5], instead a set of four parallel
additions is carried out, then a set of three parallel additions:

> However, the sequence of additions as executed by the engine does

> [Δ⁵], 5 [Δ³], 7 [Δ¹] are added to 2 [Δ⁶], 4 [Δ⁴], 6 [Δ²],and 8 [T]
> respectively. Similarly, during the second half-cycle all the

So, in fact, if we want to compute a table of cubes, to get 8 as our
second cube, we do indeed need to set Δ¹ (column 7 on the machine) to
7, as Baily says.  And then, having been used, it is incremented by Δ²
(column 6 on the machine) in the second half-cycle — but that Δ² had
previously been incremented by Δ³ in the first half-cycle.  So the
correct initial state we would need is not Baily’s (1, 7, 6, 6) but
(1, 7, 0, 6), proceeding as follows:

    | T | Δ¹ | Δ² | Δ³ |
    | 1 |  7 |  0 |  6 |
    | 8 |  7 |  6 |  6 |
    | 8 | 13 |  6 |  6 |

XXX this is the wrong answer.  If we start from Baily’s setup we get the
right answer:

    |   T | Δ¹ | Δ² | Δ³ |
    |   1 |  7 |  6 |  6 |
    |   8 |  7 | 12 |  6 |
    |   8 | 19 | 12 |  6 |
    |  27 | 19 | 18 |  6 |
    |  27 | 37 | 18 |  6 |
    |  64 | 37 | 24 |  6 |
    |  64 | 61 | 24 |  6 |
    | 125 | 61 | 30 |  6 |

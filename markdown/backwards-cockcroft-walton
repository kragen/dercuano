I was thinking about capacitive-dropper power supplies, which limit
the current from the 120V ac or 240V ac powerline with capacitive
reactance (see file `capacitor-dropper` for more.).  These can only
supply a very small current without using very beefy capacitors and
being quite hazardous.  And it has to drop a lot of voltage through
those capacitors before it reaches the load, if the load is something
like a 5V or 3.3V electronic device.

In file `bitbang-am-radio` I concluded that a Cockcroft–Walton
generator could be used as a sort of variable-ratio rectifying
autotransformer, stepping up the output dc voltage from a fixed ac
input level to a variable level determined by the load voltage.  But
if you try to use it to get a ratio of less than 1, it won't work; in
the limit of low output impedance, you just get the input ac voltage
at the output plus a dc offset that just keeps it from going negative.

Is there a Cockcroft–Walton-like circuit that works for stepping
voltages *down*?  Because then you could use a capacitive dropper to
reduce the input voltage to, say, 48 V, limited to 30 mA,
"galvanically isolated" from the input powerline by the capacitors,
and then use the Notlaw–Tforckcoc circuit to step that down to
something like 5 V at 280 mA, enough for a standard USB1 charger.

The way the Cockcroft–Walton circuit works, from a certain point of
view, is that the diodes in its string are in parallel across the ac
input (since the capacitors act somewhat like wires at ac, albeit
wires with some reactance), but in series across the dc output.  In
this case what we want is the opposite: for the diodes to be
effectively in series across the ac input while being in parallel
across the dc output.

It isn't yet obvious to me how to do this (without active control
circuitry, which can of course do this by switching capacitors around
using MOSFETs), but I suspect there might be a way.

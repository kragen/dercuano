Suppose you want to transmit data a short distance between cellphones
and Cortex-M0 devices like the STM32F0 family over ultrasound.  What’s
the simplest thing that could possibly work?

You can probably generate and even analyze audio on the cellphone in a
webpage, using the Web Audio API.  This suggests that maybe you want
to see if you can press biquad filters into service.

Probably FSK for the encoding, and probably the sweet spot for
audibility by humans but not cellphones is around 18kHz.  And the
further apart you have your frequencies, the faster your
tone-detection filters can work.  If they’re at 17.5kHz and 18.5kHz,
for example, your Q could be only about 18 and still separate them by
3dB.  A 17.5kHz square wave will be just a sine wave after it gets
through a standard audio speaker — its second harmonic is amplitude 0,
and its third harmonic is 52.5kHz, which is not going to get
reproduced by the speaker.

A Q of 18 means you get about 1kbps, which is adequate for some
applications. (?! where does this number come from)

You probably want some kind of hefty error-detection code so that you
don’t turn random noise into garbage data.

I was thinking that the Goertzel algorithm is the standard algorithm
for tone detection, but if your microphone isn’t picking up
substantial harmonics, it’s probably fairly harmless to just chop the
signal with a square wave or modified square wave, and chopping with
two square waves in quadrature should give you I and Q signals.
However, 17.5kHz and 18.5kHz are 2.52 and 2.38 samples per cycle,
respectively, at 44.1ksps, so quadrature chopping would be somewhat
tricky!  You’d have to resample to a higher sample rate first.  You
can definitely use Goertzel though.

You probably want to window the signals both on output and on input,
both to avoid spectral leakage down to the audible spectrum and to
improve discrimination between them.  Empirically, a first-order
moving average is not good enough here, unless it’s sized specifically
for the beat frequency.

I think a negative-weight feedforward comb filter on input, plus a bit more
frequency margin, might help with frequency discrimination.  Setting
the 1/0 threshold requires some amount of adaptation, empirically,
which suggests that a constant-weight code would be helpful;
Manchester encoding is the simplest, though it discards half the
bandwidth.

I’m thinking maybe 17500 Hz and 18970 Hz, which differ by 1470 Hz,
which is a period of 30 samples.  Halfway through that period, they’re
½τ out of phase, and ¼ or ¾ of the way through (7.5 and 22.5 samples),
they’re 90° out of phase, so when one is at its maximum, the other is
at its zero.  So, for example, if y(n) = x(n-7) - x(n), the 17500Hz
signal is attenuated by a factor of 0.985 (-0.13 dB, hardly at all),
while the 18970Hz signal is attenuated by -0.070 (-23 dB).  Perhaps
better, if y(n) = x(n) - x(n-5), the 17500Hz signal is attenuated by
-0.100 (-20dB) and the 18970Hz signal is attenuated by 0.812 (-1.8dB).
Similarly, if y(n) = x(n-34) - x(n), the 17500Hz signal is attenuated
by -0.050 (-26dB) and the 18970Hz signal is attenuated by 0.709
(-3dB).

So we could maybe filter each signal with a four-stage cascade.  For
17500Hz:

    y(n) = x(n-7) - x(n)
    a(n) = y(n) * cis(17500 τ n/fs)
    b(n) = a(n) + b(n-1)
    c(n) = b(n) - b(n-30)

For 18970Hz:

    y(n) = x(n-5) - x(n)
    a(n) = y(n) * cis(18970 τ n/fs)
    b(n) = a(n) + b(n-1)
    c(n) = b(n) - b(n-30)

And in practice a(n) and b(n) could be combined into a single Goertzel
stage, and the final c(n) stage can be decimated.

The initial comb-filtering stage, in addition to attenuating the
opposing signal relatively by 23dB, also works as a single-pole
high-pass filter.  The 7-sample window has its lowest resonance at
3150 Hz and other resonance peaks at 9450 Hz, 15750 Hz (the one whose
sidelobe we’re using (?)), and 22050 Hz.

XXX Oh wait this is totally wrong.  I was calculating those
attenuations based on the value of |sin(ωt)| at those points, but
actually the attenuation we want is |cos(ωt) - cos(0)|.

Thinking about how to *emit* the levels inexpensively, it occurred
that Don Lancaster’s Magic Sinewave approach might work well if the
baud time is a common multiple of the carrier periods (i.e. a multiple
of 30 samples at 44100 Hz), which is to say that the baud rate should
be a factor of 1470 Hz.  490 baud and 735 baud (90 and 60 cycles
respectively at 44100 Hz) suggest themselves.  The idea is sort of
like wavetable diphone synthesis: you divide time into 30-sample
grains (≈0.68 ms) and during each grain time you play an appropriate
precomputed grain according to the current bit, the following bit, and
your position within the bit.  So in the 735-baud case, for example,
you have two frame positions and four situations (00, 01, 10, 11), so
8 precomputed grains.  For machines with an audio DAC, in 16 bits at
44100 Hz, each of these are 30 samples and 60 bytes, so the total
wavetable is 480 bytes.  The 490-baud case would need 12 precomputed
grains.

(This is assuming that we’re using a window with support of less than
two transition intervals.)

Machines without an audio DAC probably need to compensate by using a
higher sample rate; this will be limited by their CPU load, CPU speed,
and memory.  Supposing they can afford 4 KiB of program memory to
store the wavetables, that’s 16384 samples, or 2048 samples per grain,
which works out to 3.01 megahertz, which is a low enough speed that
you don’t need fancy signal integrity stuff, and maybe it’s within
reach of even things like AVRs (which would probably need an external
ADC to receive signals, anyway).  This gives you about 68 bits per
44100sps sample; √68 ≈ 8, so I think you’ll have a signal-to-
quantization-noise amplitude of about 8, or 18.3 dB.  That’s not a
wonderful noise budget but it’s probably adequate.  Possibly we can
dither that noise up to very high frequencies where it won’t even get
digitized on the receiving end.

You might be able to win a bit more by just repeating the same grain
during the transition for the 00 and 11 cases, taking advantage of the
fact that those grains themselves are time-reversal invariant, and
time-reversing the 10 and 01 cases.

XXX wait, 17500 isn't divisible by 1470.

I did try the comb filter thing.  I’d forgotten that feedforward combs
have sharp nulls and very broad peaks.  It helps a lot.

Thanks to Nick Johnson, Ezequiel Alfie, Alastair Porter, Florian
Pignol, Arthur Sittler, Kia, Colby Kraybill, Eugene Jercinovic, Andrea
Shepard, John Bognar, and Rick Bartells for all the things I’ve
learned from them that enabled me to get this to work.  I haven’t even
mentioned it to most of them, so don’t blame them if it’s bogus.

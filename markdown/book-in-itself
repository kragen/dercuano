Darius Bacon has suggested writing a software system that is a “book
written in itself”: a book-length hypermedia literate program which is
fully self-sustaining, all the way down to hardware, and accessible to
any interested reader.

“Self-sustaining” means that the book contains full compilable source
code for itself, for a compiler with which it can be compiled, and for
a computer on which to run it.

Comparison to other related projects
------------------------------------

In a way, this is a project analogous to Knuth’s magnum opus, The Art
of Computer Programming, in that it has to cover a very broad spectrum
of computer applications — minimally: hardware design, compilers,
filesystems, operating systems (also known as kernels), garbage
collection, dynamic dispatch, windowing systems, font design, and
typographical layout; but possibly also including text editors, video
and audio codecs, data compression, database query evaluation, HTML
parsing, constraint systems, type inference, theorem proving, SAT
solving, cryptography, full-text indexing, games, numerical methods,
SPICE-like electrical simulation, CNC fabrication, and OCR (to be able
to scan its own text).

Other similar projects are the “NAND to Tetris” book, formally known
as _The Elements of Computing Systems_; and Charles Petzold’s _Code_;
the Thwaites Toaster Project; the Dave Gingery “Build a Machine Shop
from Scratch” series; the Primitive Technology series on YouTube; the
1978 port of Smalltalk-76 to the portable 8086-based NoteTaker
computer, known as Smalltalk-78, which weighed in at 200 kilobytes;
Project Oberon; Plan 9; the VPRI STEPS program to rebuild a full
personal computing environment in twenty thousand lines of code; and
the biological cell.

### Differences from TAOCP ###

The project has two enormous differences from TAOCP and some smaller
differences.

First, it’s much less ambitious in scope — TAOCP seeks to provide an
overview of all known solutions to a problem, telling the story of
their historical development and mathematically analyzing the
limitations and advantages of each solution; the Book-In-Itself need
ony provide one solution.  For example, TAOCP’s volume 3 is “Sorting
and Searching”, which covers nothing more than sorting and various
kinds of table lookup (in trees and hash tables) for 800 pages.  The
Book-In-Itself might include a single kind of hash table, or it might
need three or four different kinds of hash tables for bootstrapping or
efficiency reasons.  It probably needs sorting; a single
implementation of Heapsort is likely adequate.  In any case, it’s
unlikely to spend more than three pages on sorting and searching.  

So this reduces the project scope by a factor of 300.

Second, it’s much more ambitious in scope — TAOCP’s scope is limited
to software, and even more so, to generally applicable algorithms.
You aren’t going to find a filesystem implementation, a gate-level CPU
design, or a text layout engine in TAOCP; although its author found it
necessary to design his own font design system, his own fonts, and his
own text layout system for TAOCP, those are described in other books.

This probably increases the project scope by a factor of 10.  This
multiplies out to about 30× reduction.  Since TAOCP has taken 50 years
so far and may be done in another ten or so, this suggests that the
Book-In-Itself should take about two years of work.

Smaller differences are that the Book-In-Itself is almost certain to
be written by lower-quality authors; it’s likely to be a team effort,
rather than an individual effort; and, simply in order to be feasible,
it’s likely to suffer from Dirac-like levels of terseness.

### Differences from “NAND to Tetris” ###

The NAND to Tetris book (_The Elements of Computing Systems: Building
a Modern Computer from First Principles_, 320 pages, 2005, Nisan and
Schocken) describes a computer system, starting from NAND gates and D
flip-flops, moving up through sequential logic, the design of a
Harvard CPU called “Hack”, assembly language, bytecode interpretation,
a simple recursive-descent compiler for a “high-level” language called
“Jack”, an “operating system”, and some video games.

This is thrilling, and additionally the authors have separately
published a series of exercises and computer software to guide readers
through the implementation of the entire system themselves, rather
than simply providing them with working code.

Unfortunately, some aspects of the system are sort of fake, and some
others are overcomplicated:

- the “operating system” is just a set of device drivers and doesn’t
  provide multitasking or a filesystem;
- the “high-level” language Jack doesn’t provide garbage collection,
  function pointers, or even dynamic dispatch, and its compiler emits
  bytecode for a stack machine implemented in software rather than
  machine code;
- the hardware definition language seems to have been designed by
  software people so soft they don’t know what dynamic RAM is, don’t
  know the difference between a chip and a printed circuit board, and
  have never seen a RISC instruction set;
- the hardware doesn’t have virtual memory, interrupts, any I/O
  devices other than a screen and keyboard, or any way to modify its
  program memory;
- the tokenizer and parser output XML;
- although they have infix expression parsing, it doesn’t handle
  operator precedence;
- there is this entire unnecessary bytecode virtual machine;
- the absence of a filesystem prevents you from running the compiler
  under the “operating system”;
- the whole system is so slow that students are never expected to run
  the whole thing at once, always using a provided efficient
  implementation (written in Java) of the layer below the one they’re
  working at.  Their Pong game is 400 lines of code and compiles to
  twenty thousand lines of assembly.
- although this is subjective, all in all, the book has a somewhat
  leaden and uninspired feel; even the authors describe Jack as
  “clunky”.  After each chapter, one is left with the sad feeling that
  the functionality of the system at that point is surprisingly weak,
  given its complexity, and the forlorn hope that it will get better
  in the next chapter.

By contrast, the Book-In-Itself will not rely on separately provided
software; it will use more tasteful design choices to get surprisingly
powerful functionality instead of surprisingly weak functionality; and
it will be efficient enough to run its entire software stack
unmodified on a CPU emulated in software on a modern CPU.

One gets the idea, for example, that Jack’s syntax is “clunky” in part
by the authors not wanting to introduce backtracking, perhaps because
they don’t know about it, although they published their book three
years after Bryan Ford’s thesis came out.

### Differences from Petzold’s _Code_ ###

Where NAND to Tetris is somewhat too theoretical, idealized, and
plodding, Petzold’s _Code_ (1999) goes into nitty-gritty detail, but
doesn’t teach you enough to build a working system.  It’s considerably
more hardware-focused than NAND to Tetris, which is sort of
unfortunate, since Petzold’s hardware knowledge is a bit weak.

On page 304, for example, you have the pinout of the 2102 one-kibibit
MOS SRAM chip, state of the art in the 1970s.  At times Petzold seems
to be trapped in the 1970s, too; he claims that TTL is faster than
MOS, which stopped being true about 15 years before he published this
book.

But the book includes a lot of detail that’s hard to find coverage of
elsewhere outside of much more specialized books, including things
like DIP switches, ripple-carry adder circuits made of relays, Samuel
F.B. Morse’s hobby of making daguerreotypes, the PARC visit inspiring
Macintosh, bit-shift operators in C, the atomic number of lithium, the
PostScript format, Java bytecode, how the resistance of tungsten
varies with temperature, CP/M filesystem and memory layout, the
dynamic range of the CD-DA PCM format, tri-state MOS outputs, GNU and
Linux, circuit diagrams of master-slave edge-triggered D flip-flops,
the Sieve of Eratosthenes, redundancy in the design of UPC codes (and
their detailed decoding algorithm), the vector graphics display
screens at SAGE, the Memex, the ALGOL committees, binary-coded
decimal, IBM extended ASCII code pages, telegraph relays, the RTF
format, Siskel and Ebert movie ratings, LZW compression in the GIF
format, the number of electrons in a coulomb, Sutherland’s Sketchpad,
the process by which Louis Braille went blind, the number of fingers
usually possessed by cartoon characters, the comedic etymology of
“WYSIWYG”, the number of pins on the 8087, the IEEE-754 floating point
format, DX-encoding on 35-mm film canisters, Grace Hopper’s career
trajectory, the frequencies used by 300-baud FSK modems, the pricing
of 10-gauge hookup wire at Radio Shack, George Boole’s ancestry, ANSI
cursor-addressing escape sequences, the 8080 instruction set and
assembly syntax, Longfellow’s poem about Paul Revere, Morse code,
Radio Shack relay part numbers, NTSC sync pulse voltage levels,
logographic “contractions” in Braille, the rise of the IDE starting
from Turbo Pascal, Altair BASIC, the hardware floating-point encodings
of the IBM 704, examples of Ohm’s law, the failed GUI VisiOn, MIDI
sound cards and the structure of MIDI commands, transcendental
function approximation using Taylor expansions, and so on.

In short, it goes into enough detail that you can actually learn
things from it — it’s not at the Wired-article level of pseudo-
informative flimflam — but it’s far from presenting a complete design
for a working computer, much less a healthy software ecosystem.

The Book-In-Itself will have to omit most of the flashy, entertaining
historical detail, but will include a complete system.

### Differences from the Thwaites Toaster Project ###

Thomas Thwaites mined mica and metal ore from mines and plastic from
garbage dumps; he made a wooden mold to shape the plastic; he smelted
the metal; he refused to travel by air or use CNC mills.  After nine
months of work and US$1800 of expenses, he had an nearly functional
toaster.  Unfortunately, aside from looking terrible, it burned out
after a few seconds of operation, because his metallurgy wasn’t up to
snuff when it came to making oxidation-resistant alloys.

Thwaites complicated his life significantly by deciding to use steel
and plastic for his toaster.  His choice of Constantan for the heating
elements was probably unavoidable, but I suspect that making most of
the toaster from copper would have worked significantly better.  (To
be fair, his mentor Professor Cilliers informed him of this at the
beginning of the project.  Steel and plastic were a hair-shirt for
Thwaites.)  He made his life harder still by insisting on using the
obsolete bloomery process to smelt the iron, then lowering its carbon
content by remelting it in his microwave.

The Book-In-Itself starts at a layer above where the Toaster Project
ended: it presupposes the capacity to make complex physical artifacts,
including megahertz-class logic circuits with tens of thousands, if
not millions, of components.  However, given that capacity, the
Book-In-Itself is intended as a complete design that can execute
*itself*, rather than just a story of a personal quest, perhaps a
story that could inspire another person to undertake their own quest.

Moreover, a possible extension of the software core of the Book-In-
Itself is an automated manufacturing module, capable of fabricating
the hardware artifacts automatically, given suitable materials.  This
may or may not be included, depending on time and experiences.  It
would likely enable the Book-In-Itself to fabricate not only more
instances of itself, but also to fabricate toasters — perhaps a
*reductio ad absurdum* of Lincoln’s axe-sharpening dictum.

### Differences from the Dave Gingery series ###

Dave Gingery, and later his family, have published a series of books
on how to build a metalworking shop from scrap materials, including
techniques like hand scraping flat surfaces, sand casting of metals in
a charcoal foundry, and lathe turning.

The books are unreadable without an existing background in the
techniques they discuss; if you don’t know the names of the parts of a
lathe, you aren’t going to get very far in understanding Gingery’s
explanation of how to build one.

Unlike most of the other similar projects, the results in the Gingery
books have been successfully replicated by several people, some of
whom have documented their experiences on YouTube.

As with the Thwaites project, the Gingery series stops at a level of
abstraction below where the Book-In-Itself begins, but Gingery
succeeded in producing competent industrial machinery — not quite from
scratch, as Thwaites aspired to, but from scrap materials.  (Gingery
had the advantage of being an experienced machinist rather than a
24-year-old second-year postgraduate design student.)  But the
relationship is rather similar: the Book-In-Itself cannot be built
without the ability to construct complex artifacts, going even beyond
what the Gingery books can produce, but perhaps it could include
software modules for producing machine-shop equipment, given access to
the right materials.

### Differences from the Primitive Technology series ###

An anonymous or pseudonymous man in the rain forest in Australia is
undertaking an even more ambitious project than Thwaites’ Toaster: he
is constructing a series of artifacts made entirely with materials and
tools available in nature.  The process is meticulously documented in
a carefully edited YouTube video series and a blog.  So far, he has
created several stone axes, a stone adze, a ceramic-firing kiln, some
ceramic pots, a ceramic tiled roof, two houses (one with a hypocaust),
a woodshed, some wicker baskets, bow and push drills, a bow and arrow,
charcoal, and a fenced sweet potato patch.  He aspires to smelt iron.
So far he has not mentioned any plans for electrical appliances.

This project consists of the levels of abstraction underpinning the
Gingery project, and points out one of the reasons the Thwaites
project was so difficult: Gingery used existing industrial materials
and tools, while Thwaites attempted to abjure them.  Within Gingery’s
constraints, a toaster would be entirely feasible — perhaps a project
of a day or two, maybe a week, certainly not nine months.  But once
you’re mixing your own Constantan, you’re playing at a much higher
level of difficulty.

However, the Primitive Technology series has a purity that parallels
the purity of the Book-In-Itself: its author apparently begins with no
tools, not so much as a steel pocketknife, and thus begins his project
by banging rocks together to get split-cobble cutting edges.
Similarly, the Book-In-Itself depends — in theory — on no hardware or
software outside of the book itself; once you have the capability to
make machines of almost any kind with tens or hundreds of thousands of
parts, you need no further information-processing facilities to bring
up a complete computing environment.

There’s a crucial distinction here: the Book-In-Itself will be “self-
sustaining”, in the sense that it can easily replicate itself, and
modified versions of itself, once it’s running; but only optionally
will it be “self-bootstrapping” in the way the Primitive Technology
series is — that it’s easy to get it running starting from a minimal
basis.  A self-sustaining system is written in itself; a self-
bootstrapping system is written in something that already exists.

There are two basic approaches to adding bootstrapping to a
self-sustaining system: you can write two versions of the
bootstrapping core, one implemented in the system’s own language and
another written in some already-implemented language; or you can write
the bootstrapping core in the intersection between the language
implemented by the system and a language implemented by something
else, which may be a subset, a superset, or an extended subset of what
the system implements.  In either case, by positing different base
layers to bootstrap from, you can get very different results

In the more fundamental layers explored by Gingery, Thwaites, and the
Primitive Technology series, a self-sustaining system might consist of
a lathe; a small blast furnace, like the kind used in China in late
antiquity (around the Qin era); a charcoal-generating kiln employing
metal cans; a woodland, harvested using steel axes; a smithy, with its
hammer, tongs, anvil, and hearth; a concrete grindstone, mounted on
bearings cut on the lathe; a ceramic-firing kiln for making refractory
bricks; a cement kiln for making new grindstones; and mines for fire
clay, quartz sand, iron ore, and limestone.  But bootstrapping that
system from stone, mud, and trees is likely to involve additional
tools and materials, such as stone axes and perhaps facilities for
smelting tin and copper to make bronze tools.

Timesharing was originally intended to make computing power more
accessible by allowing you to pay for your average usage rather than
your peak usage, also promoting economies of scale through centralized
computing facilities, in the same way you could publish classified ads
in the newspaper from time to time without buying a web-fed offset
press.  In the day of the US$58 (in Argentina! retail!) 4-CPU-core
4-GPU-core 1200MHz Raspberry Pi 3, this might seem like an outdated
concept.  But there are still tasks that benefit from more computation
than the Pi can provide.

(At some point in the 1970–1990 time frame, the economies of scale
moved from the individual computers to the mass-production facilities
for their integrated circuits, so the cheapest way to provide a lot of
computing power is currently to buy a large number of some computing
device that is produced in high volumes.  Rather than amortizing the
costs of building a powerful computer over many users, we amortize the
cost of designing and making the masks for a powerful computer over
many computers.)

[Roy Longbottom benchmarked the Pi 3][0]; he got 711 million Whetstone
operations per second, in the neighborhood of 300 Whetstone megaflops
(single precision), 2500 VAX MIPS, 180 Linpack double-precision
megaflops, 486 Linpack single-precision megaflops with NEON, and 200
double-precision megaflops when memory-bandwidth limited (520 in
64-bit mode).  Linux measures it at 38 BogoMIPS.

By comparison, the NVIDIA Pascal GP100 on a mezzanine P100 GPU
Accelerator card, introduced in 2016, [provides 5 double-precision
teraflops][1], about the same as 25000 Raspberry Pi 3s.  It isn’t
available in Argentina, but [Amazon has it for about US$1500][2],
which is about US$0.06 per Pi, showing that there still are *some*
economies of scale in computation.

Moreover, I commonly run intensive computations where latency is
important, but the duty cycle is low — my peak usage would ideally be
much higher than my average usage.  With the advent of per-minute
Openstack vendors like Orange’s [Cloudwatt][3] and per-request
services like [AWS Lambda][4], it seems like it might be quite
feasible to spin up a temporary virtual supercomputer on demand.

Consider, hypothetically, that I am doing some interactive
computations, like in IPython or whatever, and I would like to keep my
interactive response time under a second; maybe I am doing 10 such
computations in a minute, 10 such minutes in an hour, and 10 such
hours in a day.  And let’s say that these computations are
embarrassingly parallel, and each such computation involves about two
minutes of calculation time on a GP100: 600 trillion floating-point
operations.

It would in theory be possible to fulfill this wish by buying three
million Raspberry Pi 3s for US$174 million, plus the networking and
electrical equipment to harness them together.  If we lower our aims
to being able to complete 100 such computations per hour, we only need
83,000 Pis, costing only US$4.8 million.

A much more practical approach would be to buy NVIDIA GPUs and ATX PCs
to plug them into, maybe two PCs per GPU; if this costs US$1750 per
GPU, then we need two GPUs (US$3500) to provide the 36-second response
provided by the five-million-dollar Pi cluster, or 72 GPUs
(US$126,000) to provide the wished-for one-second response.

[Cloudwatt charges €0.0102 per hour][5] for its t1.cw.tiny-1
instances, comparable to DigitalOcean’s smallest “droplet”, and
€0.0558 per hour for n1.cw.standard-1 instances, each with one virtual
CPU; an “instance de type haute performance” n1.cw.highcpu-2 costs
€0.0870 per hour and has two virtual CPUs.  Supposedly these [virtual
CPUs are equivalent to one Xeon processor thread][7], but they don’t
seem to say what clock speed or generation of Xeon.

Suppose we’re talking about the [Xeon E5-2687W v3 Haswell-EP system
Donald Kinghorn benchmarked at 788 gigaflops][6] (Linpack, double
precision) at 3.1 GHz in 2014.  That’s across two CPUs with 10 cores
each.  Then we should expect about 39 gigaflops per core, and maybe 20
gigaflops per core thread (assuming “hyperthreading” gives two threads
per core).  Then our 600 trillion floating-point operations work out
to about 30000 vCPU seconds.  This means that to get the computation
results in a second, we need to spin up about 15000 n1.cw.highcpu-2
instances, then shut them down after they’re idle for a minute, so we
get billed for two minutes for each of them, 30000 minutes or 500
hours in all, €43.50.

Recall that this is €43.50 for one minute of computation (with a 17%
duty cycle within that minute), and we’re doing such minutes 100 times
a day, so it works out to €4350 per day.  This comes out to the
US$126,000 (€117,000) cost of the 72-GPU cluster in only 27 days.

If we instead accept a 36-second response time, we only need about 420
n1.cpu.highcpu-2 instances, but we need them for ten hours a day,
which works out to 420·10·€0.0870 = €365 per day, which works out to
320 days to add up to the cost of the cluster.

An instructive comparison would be the cost of a personal cluster of
Xeons, since they might be a less efficient way to run your problem,
and a more direct comparison to Cloudwatt’s pricing.

I think a currently typical price for [a 3.06GHz six-core Xeon X5675
CPU is currently US$215 including shipping][8].  [BOINC measured the
E5-2687W mentioned above at 3.34 GFlops/core][9] and the X5675 at 3.13
GFlops per core, and [SETI@Home has a similar list][10], so the X5675
cores are probably more or less comparable to the ones Kinghorn was
benchmarking.  The X5675 is for an LGA-1366 socket, and a currently
typical price for [a motherboard like the SuperMicro X8DTN+ with two
LGA-1366 sockets might be US$430][11], and it has on-board Ethernet.
(I’m not 100% sure this motherboard will work for this processor, but
a similar one should.)  [4GiB of DDR3-1333 memory costs US$40
now][12], and 16GiB might be a reasonable amount to include in such a
machine, so US$160.

So a Xeon machine with 12 Xeon cores on two CPUs with 16GiB of RAM
might cost US$1020, not counting power supply, case, and labor.  A
cluster equivalent to 420 n1.cpu.highcpu-2 instances would have 210
cores and thus 18 machines, US$18,360 (comparable to the US$3500 GPU
cluster); the 15000 instances would be 7500 cores and thus 625
machines, US$637,500 (comparable to the US$126,000 GPU cluster).

So, in effect, Cloudwatt lets you use a US$18k cluster for 10 hours a
day for €365 a day (US$392/day), which pays for the cluster in 46
days, or a US$637,500 cluster for 100 or 200 minutes per day for €4350
a day (US$4650/day), which pays for the cluster in 137 days.  The
higher “efficiency” in the second case is because, in our scenario,
the duty cycle is lower for the more powerful cluster — you only have
instances spun up for 10 or 20 minutes out of each of the 10 hours
you’re using the thing.

Nevertheless, Cloudwatt’s pricing is so high that they are only a good
choice if you are experimenting with computation for a few days, even
in an apples-to-apples comparison with CPU hardware bought outright.
If you continue to do computation, you would be better off buying your
own computer; the payback time is only one to four months, and the
useful life of the computer is probably 18 months or more.

[AWS Lambda charges per 100ms multiplied by RAM usage][13],
specifically $0.00001667 per gigabyte-second, which I guess is 16.67
microdollars per gigabyte-second or 16.67 femtodollars per
byte-second, plus $0.0000002 (0.2 microdollars) per request.

[13]: https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/

100ms is three orders of magnitude finer granularity than the
per-minute billing of Cloudwatt, so you could imagine this would
result in substantially improved costs.

Let’s suppose you could farm out these one-second computations into
30000 AWS Lambda requests (maybe through four levels of request tree,
each tree request farming out to 16 subrequests, or something) which
each take one second and use 256MB of RAM during that time.  That’s
30000 seconds at 256MB, which works out to US$0.128 for the time for
the computation, plus US$0.006 for the requests.  At 10 computations
per minute, 10 minutes per hour, 10 hours per day, that’s US$128 per
day.  This is considerably better than Cloudwatt’s US$4350 per day; it
doesn’t become more expensive than buying the US$126,000 72-GPU rig
for almost 1000 days, which is probably longer than the depreciation
time for the hardware, even in the current post-Moore era.

(There’s the potential problem that even AWS Lambda functions in Java
might suffer a serious performance penalty over native code.)

However, there’s still a large efficient region in between Amazon’s
pricing and what it’s economically feasible to provide.  The 72-GPU
rig in our scenario could support multiple users.  If we expand it to
a 144-GPU rig (US$252,000), then three users need to submit a
computation during the same second for the response time to exceed the
usual second.

It isn’t obvious to me how to calculate the load statistics in closed
form, but whipping up a quick numerical simulation, it seems like with
repeated simulations with 10 users that all use the cluster during the
same hour, typically about 30 of their 1000 requests (10 per user; 3%)
will be submitted during a second which has two or more other
requests.  This lowers the cost per user to US$25,200.  So you could
probably charge each user US$50 per day (US$5 per hour) and still come
out ahead, assuming answering only 97% of requests in under 1½ seconds
(answering most requests in 500ms) is acceptable.  Scaling up the
cluster further should allow lower costs per user with lower numbers
of slow requests.

Note that the cluster could produce other value streams as well; the
10,000 requests per day still leave it 88% idle, so it could run
lower-priority batch computations at the same time.

At a smaller scale, you could imagine 32 users using US$58 Raspberry
Pi 3s (US$1900 total) submitting 250-millisecond tasks to a shared
dual-GP100 rackmount box (US$3500), which has the number-crunching
power of 50000 Pis.  At the same 100-task-per-hour pace, nearly all of
the tasks will be completed in under 500ms, though the Pi would need
four hours to complete one of them — in effect, at this low
utilization, each of the 32 users are getting nearly the full benefit
of a GP100 or two, for only US$170 each.

(The costs for the rackmount box may be a bit low.  The US$430
motherboard I linked earlier has 18 memory slots and supports up to
144 GiB of RAM; for another US$720 you could give it 72GiB of RAM,
which would work out to 2¼ GiB per user, which might be a bit low.
The motherboard, a single US$215 CPU, and 72GiB of RAM work out to
US$1365, bringing the total cost of the shared computer to US$4365,
adding an extra US$42 per user, US$136 of shared computer per user and
US$194 per user in total.)

This is one reason Google (and, presumably, Facebook) is so effective
at beating competition: it has been standard practice for more than a
decade that everyday engineers can fire off a 10,000-CPU computation
and see results within a few minutes — though not, at the time, less
than a second.

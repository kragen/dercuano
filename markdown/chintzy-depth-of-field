How do you render images with realistic depth-of-field defocus?

You can do a kind of reasonable out-of-focus blur with a Gaussian
blur, although the actual OTF of an out-of-focus camera is more like a
circular box filter.  And you can do a pretty good approximation of a
Gaussian blur with three (ordinary, non-circular) box filters.  But
the diameter of the blur changes according to how far things are from
the focal plane.

It occurs to me that maybe you can adjust the width of those box
filters dynamically as you move over the image, and that maybe this
will give you a reasonable-looking approximation of depth-of-field
blur for many images, though not all.  I’m thinking that you could
have a “weight” factor for each pixel that is highest at the focal
point and decreases as you move further from the focal point, and you
maintain a constant “weight” within the moving-average sliding window
as you slide it, sliding one or the other edge faster as necessary to
keep the weight inside the window constant.  This way, the window is
very narrow when it's at the focal plane, and very wide when it's far
away.

(This still results in computing far too many pixels for the
out-of-focus stuff, and doesn't help with blurring of reflected
images.)

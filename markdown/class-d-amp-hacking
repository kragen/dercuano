I was thinking about this 5V-output buck converter I dumpster-dived.
A plausible-looking datasheet says the input is 8–48 volts and the
output is 5V at up to 2.1 amps.  It has a feedback pin which it uses
to adjust the duty cycle of the 150kHz PWM signal it uses to generate
the output; you’re supposed to hook that up to the output side of the
inductor so it can regulate the output voltage properly.

It occurred to me that this sort of implies that if, instead of
hooking up the feedback pin directly to the output side, you hook it
up to the output side through a voltage divider to ground, you should
be able to get it to act as a 6V or 8V or 10V regulated power supply
instead of a 5V one.  Maybe it won’t compensate for load changes quite
as quickly, but I don’t think it should oscillate.

But what if, instead of using a voltage divider to ground, you use a
voltage divider to a *variable* reference voltage?  Maybe you could
make a high-power class D audio amplifier!  Say you use a
high-impedance 4:1 divider, so that a 1-V shift in the “reference”
voltage (really the input) requires a 4-V shift in the output in the
opposite direction to compensate.  It’ll be superimposed on a 20VDC
level that you probably want to block with a capacitor, but 4 volts
RMS across 8Ω should give you 500 mA RMS, which is 2 watts, which is
pretty loud.  Filtering out the 150kHz (and harmonics) carrier should
be pretty easy.

Also, you might be able to use this as an AM radio transmitter.  AM
radio is in the range 540 kHz to 1610 kHz, so there ought to be some
harmonics of the 150kHz PWM signal in there (at least the fourth
through ninth or so), and their power ought to vary with its duty
cycle.  Some experiments reveal that the second harmonic of a PWM wave
is zero at 0% power, 50% power, or 100% power (which is the same as
0%), but maximum at 25% power; the third harmonic is zero at 0% and I
guess 33⅓% and 66⅔%; the fourth harmonic is zero at the same places as
the second harmonic and also at 25% and 50% power; the fifth harmonic
at multiples of 20%; and so on.  So lower harmonics should modulate
more reliably.  If you’re trying to modulate the fourth harmonic,
you’d probably want to use a duty cycle on the steepest part of this
slope, like in between the maximum at 12½% and the minimum at 25%,
around 18.75%, which means you want to regulate the nominal output
voltage to be around 18.75% of the input voltage, and vary that
percentage according to the signal you’re trying to modulate.  Then
you “just” need to filter out the other harmonics (a bit tricky since
the actual frequency could be anywhere from 125kHz to 175kHz, so the
desired fourth harmonic could in theory be anywhere from 500kHz to
700kHz, while the undesired fifth harmonic could be anywhere from
700kHz to 875kHz), hook it up to an antenna, and tune a radio to it.

The thing isn’t designed for an output duty cycle of over 62⅕% (⅝),
but maybe using the region between the maximum at 37½% and the minimum
at 50%, like around 43.75%.  For its nominal 5V output, this would
mean an input voltage of around 11.43 volts, which is more manageable
than the input voltage needed to get 18.75%.

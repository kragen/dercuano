I’ve just read through a bunch of the CoAP RFCs (RFC 7252, say), and
although it sounds like a workable protocol (and I know people are
using it), it seems pretty suboptimal.

I may be coming at this from a kind of bad position given that I’ve
written an HTTP server that’s under 2K of code (albeit on top of
Linux’s TCP/IP stack), so I’m maybe a bit unsympathetic to arguments
claiming that a more constrained protocol is needed for more
constrained devices.

You’re going to use X.509 certificates on devices with 10 kilobytes of
RAM?  You’re mandating the secp256r1 curve?  You’re mandating AES?
That’s feasible, but AES is bigger than my entire web server, and
let’s hope none of your devices are unconstrained enough to have cache
timing attacks on the S-boxes.

You have ETags, great — but If-None-Match can’t accept one, so there’s
no way to revalidate your ETag-indexed cache with a conditional GET?
No, wait, you just send an ETag option in your request, and it works
like If-None-Match with an ETag does in HTTP.

The minimal CoAP packet size is pretty great, though.

Every path segment of up to 13 bytes needs only a single option-header
byte with a 0 option-delta nybble, except for the first one, which
will have an option-delta nybble of 11.  That’s pretty reasonable.
And they’re guaranteed to occur together in sequence.  So actually you
can get things pretty compact; here’s a 16-byte request:

    >>> m = aiocoap.Message(code=aiocoap.GET, mtype=aiocoap.CON, mid=1234)
    >>> m.opt.uri_path = ('temperature',)
    >>> m.encode()
    b'@\x01\x04\xd2\xbbtemperature'
    >>> len(_)
    16

`\xbb` there is the pair of “11” nybbles, one of which is the length
of “temperature”.  And the rest of the packet is just the four-byte
header, whose first byte encodes version 1, type 0 (CONfirmable), and
0 bytes of token length TKL, and whose second byte is GET (0.01); the
request for CONfirmation, and the message id (0x04d2).  This packet
(with a different message ID) is the first example in Appendix A.

Here’s an encoding of `GET /~kragen/sw/dev3/zmqhello.c`:

    >>> m.opt.uri_path = ('~kragen', 'sw', 'dev3', 'zmqhello.c')
    >>> m.encode()
    b'@\x01}4\xb7~kragen\x02sw\x04dev3\nzmqhello.c'
    >>> len(_)
    31

I mean, that’s not too bad, is it?  31 bytes.

There are no byte-ranges.  So you can’t use it for partial retrieval.
But that’s probably just as well.

All the multicast stuff seems kind of poorly thought out, as well as
all the security stuff.  The “resource discovery” stuff makes it sound
like they didn’t really understand REST, but its
application/link-format content-type is the only format that has a
content-format number assigned that can reasonably contain links
(assuming we discount XML XLink).

Allowing content-type sniffing even in the presence of an explicit
content-format is a terrible idea.

I suspect that the duplicate-transaction problems that RFC 1644 T/TCP
had due to lacking the three-way handshake may also afflict CoAP,
although of course REST cuts down tremendously on such problems.

A problem I’ve been wrestling with for a while is how to legibly plot
spatial densities with wide dynamic range.  Ink on paper is okay for
about 10 dB of dynamic range; reversing the video and plotting white
on black on a computer screen gives you about 20 dB; and by blooming
high-density regions outward at the cost of spatial resolution, which
is often an acceptable tradeoff, I think you can do 30 dB.  But how
can we efficiently calculate a bloom whose area accurately represents
the total magnitude within?

In 3-D rendering, convolution surfaces are implicit surfaces of a
function defined by convolving a “field function” with a “geometry
function”, a generalization of metaballs.  McCormack and Sherstyuk
1997 chose the field function 1/(1 + s²r²)² as an approximation of a
Gaussian that is more tractable to solve in closed form.

Metaballs (implicit curves of Σᵢdᵢ²/rᵢ², where rᵢ is the distance to
center point i) in 2-D have the advantage that if you put two of them
on top of each other, the total area is twice the total area they
would have if they were far apart.  There's a transition region in the
middle where they're nearly joined and a bridge joining them adds
about 20% to their total area.  Unfortunately, they are difficult to
calculate efficiently.

Is there perhaps an efficient way to convolve metaballs, or an
approximation thereof, with the points you want to plot, in order to
get the size of the total area to fill with light?

(A different approach would be to use a vector CRT or laser-light
display, which can natively reach 30dB of dynamic range without
sacrificing spatial resolution — indeed, improving it.)

A two-operand calculator supporting programming by demonstration
================================================================

Historical programmable calculators have mostly either used
BASIC-style infix expressions and jumps, or FORTH-style stack
operations.  When I’m programming, I find FORTH code more bug-prone
than register-to-register code.  Could you design a usable
programmable calculator using a non-stack-machine machine code?  I
think so, and in fact, I think you could make it more usable than
traditional calculators by taking advantage of programming by
demonstration.

Or, to put it another way, how easy could you make programming in raw
machine code, so that you don’t wish for an assembler?

Physical description
--------------------

In front of you is a box with an unusual keyboard and two knobs, one
above the other, each with a 16-digit numeric LCD display next to it.
Each knob has 16 positions around it labeled with the letters J
through Y.  A third knob with a third display is located below the
keypad; it also turns indefinitely in either direction, with a larger
number of detents.  The top knob and display are labeled Γ; the bottom
knob and display are labeled Δ.  Turning a knob to one of its 16
positions selects the number displayed on its display; there are 16
different such numbers.  Both knobs access the same set of numbers;
when they are turned to the same position, they display the same
number.

There is also a peripherals box connected to it with a cable which
will be described later.

The keypad looks like this:

<!--

    | 0↓ | 1↓ | 2↓ | 3↓ | ± | B | C |
    |----+----+----+----+---+---+---|

XXX missing: `>>`, `<<`, some way to swap stacks

Calculation
-----------

The numeric keys enter a number into the upper display, Γ. If a number
was there previously, it is replaced, unless the last thing you did
was also a numeric or backspace key, in which case it is appended to
the number there.  The backspace key (<span class="key">⇐</span>) removes the last digit from
the number.  If you turn the Γ knob away from that position, the
displayed number will change, but when you turn it back to that
position, the number you entered is still there.  If the Δ knob is in
the same position, the same number shows on both displays, and they
update together.

This is because the machine contains 16 registers, named P, Q, R, S,
T, U, V, W, X, Y, J, K, L, M, N, and O, and the knobs select which of
the registers is displayed on each display at each moment.

The arithmetic keys
<span class="key">+</span><span class="key">-</span><span class="key">×</span>
alter the number on the Δ display by
respectively adding to it, subtracting from it, or multiplying by it
the number on the Γ display.  The Γ number remains unchanged, unless
both knobs are in the same position, in which case it shows the same
number as Δ.

The arithmetic key <span class="key">/%</span>
alters Δ by dividing it by Γ, leaving the
quotient in Δ, but does not leave Γ unchanged; rather, it leaves the
remainder in Γ.  The quotient is rounded toward zero, and the remainder
is consequently sometimes negative.

XXX maybe use 32.32 fixed-point?  × differs only by a right shift but
<span class="key">/%</span> differs radically.

The <span class="key">±</span> key changes the sign of the number in Γ.

So far, this allows simple use of the machine as an integer (XXX?)
calculator.  You select some register with both Γ and Δ, type a
starting number into it, and then select a different register with Γ
and type more numbers into it and apply operations to update your Δ
accumulator.

The keys
<span class="key">^</span><span class="key">~</span><span class="key">&amp;</span><span class="key">|</span>
are similar to the arithmetic keys, but perform bitwise
operations on the numbers: XOR, NOT, AND, and OR, respectively.  <span class="key">~</span>
applies only to Γ, not to Δ, on the theory that much of the time that
you invert the bits in a number, it’s because you’re about to use it
to clear some bits in something else.  You can pull out either knob to
set the corresponding display to hexadecimal, or push it back in to go
to decimal.

Memory
------

The <span class="key">@</span> and <span class="key">!</span>
keys use Γ as an address into a larger “main memory”
of 65536 numbers; <span class="key">@</span>
reads main memory at the address Γ and copies it into
Δ, while <span class="key">!</span>
copies Δ to main memory at the address Γ.  The display below
the keypad displays one of the numbers in this memory, and the knob
moves backwards and forwards in this memory.  It has a narrow stem in
the middle to allow spinning it quickly, and this implements something
like mouse acceleration so that you can scroll rapidly through memory.
Main memory is nonvolatile, retaining its contents even when the
device is unplugged.

Programmability
---------------

The other keys are somewhat more difficult to explain, because they
pertain to the device’s programmability.

### Defining subroutines ###

Whenever you are typing, the
program counter displayed in the display below the keypad advances,
recording your instructions in the memory so that you can replay them
later; numeric entry is not recorded until it is complete, so
backspace does not create a program instructions, nor does typing a
number followed by
<span class="key">:</span> or a few other things.  The
<span class="key">:</span> key marks a
label, which can be used as the beginning of a subroutine or loop.
This is implemented by storing the current program counter at address
Γ and magically restoring Γ to its previous value.  The
<span class="key">;</span> key marks
a return address; it has no effect on the Γ and Δ registers, so its
only immediate effect is to store an instruction in memory.

This means that you can define a subroutine by doing a calculation,
typing <span class="key">;</span>,
then using the third knob below the keypad to scroll back
in memory to the beginning of the calculation, entering a subroutine
number, and pressing <span class="key">:</span>.
Or you can enter the subroutine number and
<span class="key">:</span>, then do the calculation.  This third knob’s somewhat larger
display shows a main memory address and its contents in two formats:
as a decimal number and in a strange alphabetic hexadecimal format,
the same one used to label the register knobs.

Only numbers in [0, 511] are valid labels due to the instruction
encoding.

There is the potential to accidentally overwrite things by recording
an interactive computation in this way, so you may want to use the
third knob to jump backwards from time to time when you aren’t recording
things on purpose.

### Interactive mode and execution mode ###

Once a subroutine is defined, you can invoke it with the
<span class="key">↓</span> key,
which calls the subroutine whose label number is displayed in Γ by pushing the
program counter on a stack and fetching from memory at the number displayed in Γ into the
program counter.  An extra bit in the program counter tracks whether
the machine is in interactive mode or execution mode, so upon
returning from the subroutine from an interactive call, the machine
reverts to interactive use.  The
<span class="key">B</span>, and
<span class="key">C</span> keys interact with this
bit:
<span class="key">B</span> in execution mode sets the machine to interactive mode
(pausing whatever program is running) and
<span class="key">C</span> sets it to execution
mode, resuming the paused subroutine.
<span class="key">B</span> in interactive mode is used
for single-stepping; in most cases, it simply interactively executes
the instruction at the program counter without leaving interactive
mode, but if that instruction is a ↓ or `;`, its effect is slightly
modified — the interactive bit remains set after the context switch,
so you can single-step through the subroutine as well.  (Or you can
continue until its exit with <span class="key">C</span>.)

This fact of having an interactive bit saved on the stack with the
return address allows you a lot of debugging flexibility.  You can
interrupt the program at any point with
<span class="key">B</span> to see what it’s doing,
then
<span class="key">C</span>
to continue, even if you’re nested inside some other similar
debugging session higher up the stack.  You can update the contents of
the registers by typing numbers followed by
<span class="key">B</span> to step to the next
instruction.

XXX exactly when entered numbers get stored into the instruction
stream needs some clarification.  What if you turn the Γ knob to
modify multiple registers before typing <span class="key">B</span>?

### Shortcut keys ###

The <span class="key">0↓</span>,
<span class="key">1↓</span>,
<span class="key">2↓</span>, and
<span class="key">3↓</span> keys are shortcut keys to call the
subroutines whose addresses are stored at addresses 0, 1, 2, and 3.
This allows you to implement simple applications just by vectoring
those functions to subroutines of your choice and, perhaps, placing
stickers on the keys.

### Local variables ###

Registers P through W are saved and restored on the stack in memory
along with the program counter by the `↓` call
and `;` return instructions, making
them local variables in each subroutine.  However, because they are
copied to the stack during the call instruction, their value in the
caller is available in the callee; so you can use them to pass
parameters, and the callee’s changes to those parameters will be
automatically discarded upon return.  So if the callee wants to return
values to the caller, it should put them into one of the other
registers, such as X and Y.

### Conditionals ###

The <span class="key">{</span>
key adds a conditional jump instruction to the program and
stores the address of that jump instruction on a special small stack
not stored in main memory; the
<span class="key">}</span> key then backpatches that
conditional jump to point to the current program counter.  The
conditional jump jumps if Δ is zero.  In order to preserve the
programming-by-demonstration feel of the machine, all 16 data
registers are also stored on that stack and restored when you type
<span class="key">}</span>.

The <span class="key">&gt;</span>
key sets Δ to 0 if it was negative.  This means that the
sequence `->{…}` executes the `…` only if Δ was greater than Γ
originally.

### Unconditional jumps and loops ###

The <span class="key">←</span>
key fetches an address from the address Γ points to and adds a
jump to that address to the current program.  This is basically
intended for loops: you type, say,
<span class="key">8</span><span class="key">:</span>
at the beginning of the loop,
and then <span class="key">8</span><span class="key">←</span>
at the end of the loop; but it can also be used for
subroutine tail calls.  I’m not sure what it should do in interactive
mode.

Generally you will want to use <span class="key">{</span> and <span
class="key">}</span> inside the loop in order to make it not infinite.
In particular, <span class="key">{</span><span
class="key">;</span><span class="key">}</span> conditionally
terminates the subroutine the loop is within.

### Wide program counter ###

Because memory words are fairly large (64 bits?) several instructions
can normally fit into one; the opcode field is 4 bits and the source
and destination register fields are 4 bits each, for a slightly
awkward total of 12 bits.  This makes the program counter three bits
wider than the usual 16-bit memory addresses, plus the interactive
bit, which allows single-stepping at sub-instruction-word granularity,
as well as returns, calls, and jumps into the middle of instruction
words.

Interrupts
----------

No.

Peripherals
-----------

In addition to the three numeric displays already mentioned, there are
some other peripherals on the calculator, mostly in the peripherals box.

When the value of the last register, register O, changes, there is an
audible click whose volume increases with the magnitude of the change.
This is because register 15 is connected to a digital-to-analog
converter which is connected to a speaker.

The peripherals box has eight smoothly turning dials on it.  The
current positions of these dials are mapped into main memory at
positions 0x7f00 (WOPP) through 0x7f08 (WOPX).

The current time is always available in memory at address 0x7f09
(WOPY).

There is a 320×240 touchscreen LCD display on the peripheral box with
16-bit color and an integrated framebuffer.  The current touches are
available in addresses 0x7f10 (WOQP) through 0x7f14 (WOQT);
each one contains X and
Y coordinates and an active bit to indicate whether it’s active or
not.  Its current vertical scan position is in 0x7f15 (WOQU).
By placing 80
64-bit words in the addresses starting at 0x7f20 (WORP) and writing a scan
line number to 0x7f70 (WOWP), you can update a scan line on the display.

There is a switch on the peripherals box attached to an LED that
illuminates a sign saying “RECORDING” and a microphone.  When the
switch is turned on, the LED flashes, and the current microphone sound
pressure level is available at 0x7f30 (WOSP).

When in execution mode rather than interactive mode, the current
34-bit state of the keyboard (except for the
<span class="key">B</span> key, which returns to
interactive mode) is available at 0x7f40 (WOTP).

Machine code encoding
---------------------

This is especially important on this machine because if you’re writing
the machine code without an assembler, you’re probably also reading it
without a disassembler, and indeed the third knob and display are
designed for this.

Each instruction except for immediate constants is 12 bits, 3 nibbles.
A memory word is 64 bits, 16 nibbles; this allows space for five
instructions in 60 bits, plus an extra one-nibble tag field which is
used for literals.  Normally it is 1111 (f/O) but when it is 0000
(0/P) the word is a literal word with 56 bits of immediate data, here
nibbles labeled nd through n0.
             
<!--
    | 1111 | op0 | A0 | B0 | op1 | A1 | B1 | op2 | A2 | B2 | op3 | A3 | B3 | op4 | A4 | B4 |
    | 0000 | reg | nd | nc | nb  | na | n9 | n8  | n7 | n6 | n5  | n4 | n3 | n2  | n1 | n0 |
-->

<table class="encoding">
    <tr><th>nibble<th>f <th>e <th>d <th>c <th>b <th>a <th>9 <th>8 <th>7 <th>6 <th>5 <th>4 <th>3 <th>2 <th>1 <th>0

    <tr><th>literal<td>0000 <td>reg <td>nd <td>nc <td>nb  <td>na <td>n9 <td>n8  <td>n7 <td>n6 <td>n5  <td>n4 <td>n3 <td>n2  <td>n1 <td>n0
</table>

<style>
.encoding { border-spacing: 0; border-width: 0 0 1px 1px }
.encoding td, .encoding th { border-width: 1px 1px 0 0; padding: .3em; text-align: center }
.encoding, .encoding td, .encoding th { border-style: solid; border-color: black }
</style>

The fields labeled An and Bn vary in interpretation according to the
instruction format; for two-operand instructions, they are generally
the source and destination registers; for one-operand instructions, An
specifies the instruction and Bn specifies the operand register; and
for zero-operand instructions, all three fields specify the
instruction.

### Two-operand instructions ###

Optimizing for 12 bits and hexadecimal legibility, the two-operand
opcode format is as follows:

<!--
    | opcode | Γ    | Δ    |
    |--------+------+------|
    | xxxx   | xxxx | xxxx |
-->

<table class="encoding">
   <tr><th>opcode<th>Γ<th>Δ
   <tr><td>xxxx<td>xxxx<td>xxxx
</table>

The Γ source and Δ dest fields each identify one of the 16 registers
(with the low 4 bits of the register’s letter), and the opcode fields
identify one of the two-operand operations:

<!--
Outdated table:

    | conventional hex | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3  | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | a | b | c | d | e | f |
    |                  | + | - | × | /% |   | ^ | & | | | ! | @ |   |   |   |   |   |   |
    | ASCII alphahex   | P | Q | R | S  | T | U | V | W | X | Y | J | K | L | M | N | O |
-->

<table class="encoding">
   <tr><th>conventional hex<td>0<td>1<td>2<td>3 <td>4<td>5<td>6<td>7<td>8<td>9<td>a<td>b<td>c<td>d<td>e<td>f
   <tr><th>operation       <td>+<td>-<td>×<td>/%<td>{<td>^<td>&<td>|<td>!<td>@<td> <td>one-operand<br/>(see below)<td colspan="4">(control flow)<br/>(see below)
   <tr><th>ASCII alphahex  <td>P<td>Q<td>R<td>S <td>T<td>U<td>V<td>W<td>X<td>Y<td>J<td>K<td>L<td>M<td>N<td>O
</table>

This means, for example, that the three-nibble sequence PTJ means “J = T + J”.

For most of these operations, as explained earlier in the section
about the user interface, the source operand Γ is left unchanged and
the destination operand Δ gets the result.  There are two exceptions:
/%, which like the <span class="key">/%</span> key, leaves the
remainder from the division in the source operand; and `{`.

`{` tests the source operand Γ to see if it’s 0, and if so, executes a
forward jump.  The destination operand field Δ is not treated as a
register reference at all.  Rather, its value from 0 to 15 indicates a
number of instruction *words* to skip over, starting from the
instruction word following the word containing the `{` instruction.
That means that when the Δ field is 0, the conditional jump goes to
the beginning of the next instruction word, skipping up to four
instructions; when the Δ field is 1, the conditional jump goes to the
beginning of the instruction word after that, skipping 5, 6, 7, 8, or
9 operations (or possibly only 1 to 5 if the next instruction word was
a literal word); and so on up to 15, which skips 15 entire instruction
words, plus the remainder of the word containing `{`.  If the register
indicated by Γ was nonzero, however, instruction continues as if
nothing had happened.

This means that the `}` key may need to insert nop operations to fill
out the current instruction word, so that it has a word-aligned
address to backpatch the `{` instruction with.  This is an annoying
amount of complexity to attach to a key, but the alternative would be
to only enable `{` to skip over up to 16 *instructions*, rather than
up to 84, which would be a painfully anemic conditional.  (But hey, HP
calculators’ conditional only skipped a single instruction.)  Still,
the complexity involved here is small compared to the complexity of
division or procedure calls.

### One-operand instructions ###

There’s a different format for one-operand operations:

<!--
    | opcode     | xop  | reg  |
    | 1011 (b/K) | xxxx | xxxx |
-->

<table class="encoding">
    <tr><th>opcode<th>xop<th>reg
    <tr><td>1011 (b/K)<td>xxxx<td>xxxx
</table>

The one-operand operations are encoded with the following xop values:

<!--
Outdated table:

    | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7     | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
    | 0 | 1 | 2 | ~ | ± | { | > | ;/nop |   |   |    |    |    |    | -2 | -1 |
    | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W     | X | Y |  J |  K |  L |  M |  N |  O |
-->

<table class="encoding">
   <tr><th>conventional hex<td>0<td>1<td>2<td>3<td>4<td>5<td>6<td>7    <td>8<td>9<td>a<td>b<td>c<td>d<td>e<td>f
   <tr><th>operation       <td>0<td>1<td>2<td>~<td>±<td> <td>><td>;/nop<td> <td> <td>  <td>  <td>  <td>  <td>-2<td>-1
   <tr><th>ASCII alphahex  <td>P<td>Q<td>R<td>S<td>T<td>U<td>V<td>W    <td>X<td>Y<td> J<td> K<td> L<td> M<td> N<td> O
</table>

The operations named with numbers set the register to that constant.

### Zero-operand instructions ###

`;` and nop need no operands, so we distinguish between them by the
register field: 0 for nop, 1 for `;`.

### Instructions taking labels ###

Looking at what’s left of the keyboard, <span class="key">:</span> just defines a label; it
doesn’t add anything to the instruction stream.  <span class="key">B</span> break, <span class="key">C</span>
continue, and
<span class="key">⇐</span>
backspace similarly are purely interactive
operations.  However, both ← and ↓ require a label number, which is
not actually taken from Γ (that’s just the interactive user
interface!) but encoded in the instruction.  These are encoded with a
9-bit label number field:

<!--
    | opcode | label       | (meaning) |
    |    110 | x xxxx xxxx | ←, goto   |
    |    111 | x xxxx xxxx | ↓, call   |
-->

<table class="encoding">
    <tr><th>opcode<th>label<th>(meaning)
    <tr><td>110   <td>x xxxx xxxx<td>←, goto
    <tr><td>111   <td>x xxxx xxxx<td>↓, call
</table>

### Literals (immediate data) ###

As mentioned above, literals larger than ±2 are encoded using an
entire instruction word by putting tag 0000 in the first nibble of an
instruction word, followed by a destination register and 56 bits of
literal data.  The literal data is sign-extended to put it into the
specified register.  In particular, this means that a memory word
containing a positive number less than 2⁵⁶ can be interpreted as an
instruction to load that number into register 0 (P), which is a
technique that you can use to improve the legibility of your program.

### Examples ###

So an instruction word written in alphahex as O PTJ PUT KTU KWP consists
of two addition instructions (J += T; T += U), a negation instruction
(U = -U), and a nop.

XXX reshuffle opcodes for ASCIIhex legibility.  P for + is good, maybe
M or L for -, T or M for ×, O or Q or R for /%, N for ~, X for ^, S
for !, L for @, which leaves the less important & and | to get less
desirable letters.  But we need groups of two letters for ← and ↓,
chosen from PQ, RS, TU, VW, XY, JK, LM, or NO.  JK suggests “jump” and
TU suggests “to” (maybe shuffle × off to M), but nothing in particular
suggests “call” or “invoke”.

XXX maybe use BCD?

XXX maybe merge &, ^, and ~ into a NAND operation, given their
relative rarity?  Maybe add a MOV operation?

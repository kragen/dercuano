This is a fantastic comment thread!  I especially appreciate the reference to the MJT book.

I’ve hung out with a few cranks in my time.  One person I know, who’s
extremely well-respected in his field (which is not a science), is
trying to publish a book on an improved version of the Titius–Bode
law.  I suggested that when he’s sending a draft to researchers who
have expressed interest, he should leave out the chapter on how the
planets’ orbits relate to musical scales, at least.

And I’ve had some lovely conversations with Ed Fredkin, a brilliant
computer scientist who says, “I’m very interested in physics, but
physicists are very uninterested in me being interested in physics.”
Maybe one of these days he will turn out to have been right, that the
universe really is some kind of simple automaton.  His work has gone
on to inspire another famous crank, Stephen Wolfram, who (again) has
done some solid academic work — before giving up altogether on
academic norms like giving Fredkin credit and not suing your
collaborators for publishing papers on their work.

And a few weeks ago, I had the privilege to sit next to Carl Hewitt in
a meeting.  Some ideas he was exploring in the 1970s have been the
basis for a large fraction of the work in programming languages in the
80s, 90s, and today (Erlang, the latest hot language, is largely the
latest realization of his Actors model), so he’s the real deal.  He
gave me a copy of a paper he’s working on about nonstratified
inference in paraconsistent logics; I haven’t been able to make heads
or tails of it yet, partly because my grounding in symbolic logic is
pretty weak.  So what’s his crank-hood?  He was banned from editing
Wikipedia because he kept editing physics articles to explain the
importance of the Actors Model in physics.  (Maybe he’ll turn out to
be right, but I think for now there are problems with Bell’s
Inequality, which is also a problem with Wolfram’s ideas.)

Worse are the cases where cranks like <a
href="http://jef.raskincenter.org/published/NursingTheoryForSite.html">Martha Rogers</a> have actually gotten their crazy ideas inside the
academy, destroying it from within.

(I haven’t met Wolfram or Rogers.)

I have a <a href="http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/">mailing list to publish my own crazy ideas</a>, but I try not to get
too attached to them.  I hope that some of them might be significant
enough to turn into academic publications, but I’m constantly
terrified that I’ll turn into a crank myself.  The major thing
distinguishing me from the people I’ve listed above, then, would be
that they have accomplished some significant things before retiring
into crankhood, while I’m just some guy.

It would probably be helpful for people like me to have a guide to the
warning signs of crankhood, with examples.  Obviously, if this just
allowed cranks to take on protective coloring and infiltrate academic
mailboxes with greater ease, it would not be a public service; but if
it could enable some of us non-academics to recognize when we’re being
insufficiently critical of our own ideas, and perhaps in the
occasional case that we have some idea that’s actually worthwhile, to
figure out how to distinguish it from our less worthwhile ideas and
then present it in a way that its merit could be detectable — that
might have the effect of actually diminishing the amount of wacko mail
that comes in.

Oh, and there was this time I was at Google just after lunching with
some friends there, sitting down outside with my laptop on the edge of
the grounds before leaving, and the security guards were politely
turning away a guy who just <i>had</i> to present his just-patented
invention to <i>somebody</i>, <i>anybody</i> at Google — but he
didn’t actually know anybody there, and wasn’t willing to disclose
anything about his invention.

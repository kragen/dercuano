The current fashion of “NoSQL” key-value stores reminds me that Unix
has shipped with a NoSQL key-value store since Seventh Edition Unix in
1979, written by Ken Thompson and called dbm.  Dbm files are on-disk
hash tables mapping strings to strings, and they are used by many Unix
programs — Sendmail and Postfix, for example, support storing
arbitrary tables related to mail delivery in dbm files, and Apache
supports using dbm files for many purposes.  They’re supported by a
dbm library, which generally only works properly if at most one
program has them open at a time.  You don’t normally connect to a “dbm
server”, but rather open the file and lock it.

History
-------

The 1979 dbm interface looks like this, in modern ANSI C parlance:

    typedef struct { char *dptr; int dsize; } datum; 
    int   dbminit  (const char *name);
    int   store    (datum key, datum content);
    datum fetch    (datum key);
    int   delete   (datum key);
    datum firstkey ();
    datum nextkey  (datum key);
    int   dbmclose ();

(Adapted from the GDBM docs.)

This is very simple, and it’s easy to figure out how to use it, aside
from an allocation issue I mention below, but you can perhaps see some
problems right there in the interface — not only do `store()` and
`fetch()` and the like not have a namespace prefix, making it easy to
have collisions with your functions, but also they don’t have a
parameter to tell you which dbm file to access!  That means you can
only have one dbm file open at a time in a single process, but on the
PDP-11 that V7 Unix ran on, the process’s entire address space was
only 64KiB, so you couldn’t do too much in one process anyway.

The dbm file uses a scheme called “extendible hashing” to allow the
on-disk hash table to grow smoothly as data is added to the file,
though in a way that requires the underlying filesystem (and your
backup programs!) to handle sparse files efficiently.

The original dbm was more or less replaced with Berkeley ndbm in 1986,
which solved those interface problems, but, as I understand it, still
used the same limited disk file format.  Other more or less enhanced
clones included sdbm (1987), GDBM (1990–2002), Berkeley DB (1991 to
present), QDBM (2000, QDBM’s successor Tokyo Cabinet, TDB, its variant ntdb,
tdbm, Larry McVoy’s memory-mapped MDBM (significantly enhanced this
millennium by Yahoo), and a pure-Python implementation called dumbdbm.

In the original dbm interface, it isn’t obvious from the API where the
buffer space for the fetched data comes from, and in particular when
it will be reused — in GDBM, at least, it’s `malloc`ed, and the caller
must free it, even if they only cared about testing whether the key is
present or not.  But that would be an unlikely thing for 1979 Unix to
do (it was very shy about dynamic allocation) and GDBM’s compatibility
ndbm interface frees it for you on the next call, whether you like it
or not.  I infer that probably dbm and ndbm returned you a pointer to
a static buffer.  And, indeed, [we can see the fetch function in 1979
dbm doing exactly that][0]; `pagbuf` is a static buffer defined (!) in
`dbm.h`.

### cdb ###

One dbm replacement is particularly interesting, because instead of
being an enhanced version of dbm, it was a deliberately more limited
version.

When Daniel Bernstein decided to write a secure replacement for
Sendmail in 1995, called qmail, he was faced with the problem that
existing C libraries were full of unreliabilities, poor performance,
and security holes, just like Sendmail itself.  He solved this problem
by writing replacements for all of the standard C library
functionality that he needed, from scratch, without any functionality
he did not need, and without bugs.  One of the things he needed was a
rough equivalent of dbm, but he did not need dbm’s ability to
incrementally update an existing database.  So the qmail equivalent of
dbm is called “cdb”, “constant database”, and it consists of 329 lines
of C.  The read interface consists of these two functions:

    int cdb_seek(int fd, char *key, unsigned int len, uint32 *dlen);
    int cdb_bread(int fd, char *buf, int len);

`cdb_seek` returns 1 if `key` of length `len` is present in the file
open on file descriptor `fd`, 0 if not, and -1 on I/O error, storing
the length at `dlen`; `cdb_bread` then reads the corresponding value,
if desired, into `buf`, returning -1 on error, including truncated
files, or 0 on success.

Rather than using the extendible-hashing algorithms used by dbm, the
cdb file is always divided into 256 hash buckets, described by a 2KiB
table at the beginning of the file, whose format limits it to 4GiB.
And the code to generate the file builds a hash table with separate
chaining in memory, then writes it to the file once insertion is
complete.

cdb is less featureful and presumably less performant than other
variants of dbm, but because it likely has no bugs and is only about 2
kilobytes of executable code, it may be preferable at times.

### Language integration ###

Perl 4 had native support for dbm files, and a lot of websites that
graduated from storing their data in static text files started to use
dbm files instead.  Perl 4 was the first widely-used garbage-collected
language; most of the shift from static websites to web applications
in 1994 and 1995 was implemented in Perl, and many sites still didn’t
have Perl 5 installed.

Python, too, has shipped with support for dbm files for a very long
time.

Why not just use a filesystem directory?
----------------------------------------

You might reasonably ask why people used dbm files, which after all
merely map sequences of bytes to sequences of bytes, when the
filesystem already performs this function.  The reason is that, at the
time, most Unix filesystems still used sequential search in filesystem
directories for filenames, and as a result, directories with more than
a few dozen files in them started to get slow.  If you are going to
maintain a table and then sequentially search it, you can just use a
text file for that.  (And Unix does, all over the place.)  Also, in
most Unix filesystems, files take up at least 256 bytes or so.

The Pick operating system and the ReiserFS filesystem for Linux were
based on making the normal filesystem apt for this kind of purpose,
rather than trying to build the facilities in userspace.  Various
forms of Pick are still around, but ReiserFS ran into performance
limitations in the Linux system call interface, then lost its
influence after Hans Reiser murdered his wife in 2007 and was not able
to effectively lead the project from prison.

The filesystem interface requires at least three system calls to get
the contents of a file: open(), read(), and (in the steady state,
anyway) close().  Even today, [Linux system calls require on the order
of a microsecond][1], about 300ns on my machine, so about 1 μs for the
three put together, which will limit you to about 300k such file reads
per second on a single thread.  By comparison, [MDBM can manage about
450 ns per random read][2].  One of the last controversial projects of
Reiser’s company was a system for batching up a whole sequence of
Reiser4 operations into a single system call.

Why not SQL?
------------

So we used dbm files for all kinds of things, including things where a
relational database would worked a lot better.  You might wonder why
we didn’t just use relational databases.

The problem is, there were no decent free software SQL databases.
University INGRES was, as I recall, available, but it had its own
query language (“QUEL”) and didn’t support SQL; its development had
ended in 1985, though Wikipedia tells me that Sybase and Microsoft SQL
Server were developed from that codebase.  At Berkeley they were
developing Postgres, which was licensed to Illustra about 1994 as an
“object-relational database,” and eventually sold to INFORMIX, but
Postgres was slow and unreliable, and it didn’t support SQL either,
yet — its query language was a thing called “POSTQUEL”.  SQLite and
MySQL and MariaDB and even Gadfly didn’t exist yet.

A lot of people did build web sites and things with SQL database
backends, including well-known companies like Amazon and eBay and
lesser-known companies like ArsDigita, which was in many ways the
prototype for Google.  But they had to license proprietary databases
to do it.

There was additionally the problem that relational databases were very
heavyweight, like Cassandra today — you couldn’t run them at all on a
low-end machine, and you universally had to run them in a separate
process and connect your app to them via IPC — sockets or whatever.
(This was partly ideological.  As Stonebraker said in the original
Postgres — excuse me, POSTGRES — paper, “DBMS code must run as a
sparate process from the application programs that access the database
in order to provide data protection.”)  You probably had to have a
separate machine to run the database server on, a workstation or maybe
a tower-case PC.  This kind of nonsense meant that there was no
possible way to use .  This may be hard to imagine now that most
cellphones have dozens of SQL databases in them (mostly SQLite) but
consider that, even today, starting up `sqlite3` linked with glibc and
opening a database, you’re already using 27 megs of virtual memory:

    USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
    user     26485  0.0  0.0  26916  3728 pts/3    T    01:47   0:00 sqlite3 hello.d

Until the DRAM price bubble burst in 1995 or 1996, DRAM cost US$40 per
megabyte for years due to collusion in a cartel of DRAM manufacturers,
so that was about US$1000 worth of memory.

(This level of bloat is probably mostly glibc’s fault.  The sqlite3
binary and library are under a megabyte.)

In 1994, David Hughes in Australia sparked a revolution by writing a
simple SQL database he called “mSQL” (for “mini SQL”) and releasing it
with source code, but not as open source — it was “free for
noncommercial use” only.  In 1995, he founded a company he called
Hughes Technologies to commercialize it.  But that’s another story,
so I am going to return to talking about dbm.

Crash safety
------------

In the environment Unix grew up in, a power loss was a catastrophic
event, similar to a disk head crash, a datacenter fire, or a memory
corruption bug in the kernel.  Some other operating systems had
crashproof filesystems which were designed not to lose data in the
event of power loss, but Unix did not, and indeed this was one of the
desiderata in the original plans for the GNU system — GNU would be
better than Unix because its filesystem would have versioning and be
crashproof.

Corrupting your filesystem and losing files on power loss was still
common in Linux up until about 2004 or 2005, at which point ext3fs and
other journaled filesystems put an end to that problem, for the most
part.

Nowadays, by contrast, it is very common for Unix machines to lose
power — their batteries may run out, or you may drop them on the
sidewalk and joggle the battery out of touch with the contacts.  By
contrast, memory corruption bugs in the kernel and cellphone fires are
vanishingly rare, and SSDs have no moving parts and therefore don’t
have head crashes.

However, if there are consistency constraints inside some file that is
being written to in random places, it’s possible for an inconsistent,
acausal snapshot of that file to be what survives.  Unix provides an
`fsync()` system call to limit the possibilities for such
inconsistencies — it doesn’t return until all the data for the file in
question is safely saved on disk.  This guarantees two relevant properties:

1. If `fsync()` returns and the program takes some action afterwards,
   such as displaying a user interface message or sending a packet
   over the network, then if we observe this action, then we know that
   the data written before `fsync()` will not be lost.
2. Either all data written before `fsync()` is preserved, or no data
   written after `fsync()` is preserved, or both.  It is never the
   case that some data written after `fsync()` is preserved, while
   some data written before `fsync()` is lost.  That is, `fsync()`
   serves as a “write fence”.

Property #2 is necessary to guarantee the atomicity and consistency
properties of transactions; property #1 is necessary to guarantee the
durability property of transactions.

However, because property #1 is very expensive to provide, especially
on spinning-rust disks, it is very common that programs do not bother.
There was a great deal of controversy a few years back over MongoDB
doing this in order to get better performance numbers, but you will of
course see that the MDBM numbers I cited earlier are taken under the
same conditions, and the GDBM manual explains:

> …the following may be added added to `read_write` by bitwise or:
> `GDBM_SYNC`, which causes all database operations to be synchronized
> to the disk, and `GDBM_NOLOCK`, which prevents the library from

> 
> Unless your database was opened with the `GDBM_SYNC` flag, gdbm does
> not wait for writes to be flushed to the disk before continuing.
> The following routine can be used to guarantee that the database is
> physically written to the disk file.
>
>     gdbm_sync ( dbf )
>
> It will not return until the disk file state is syncronized [sic]
> with the in-memory state of the database.

Unfortunately, because omitting `fsync()` endangers not only
property #1 but also property #2, it is entirely possible for a GDBM
file to be corrupt after a power outage.  In the case of GDBM,
although I haven’t verified this, I think this means that some
previously stored data that wasn’t being modified could be
irretrievable, but not necessarily all of it.

Worse, making this work properly typically involves inserting an
`fsync()` as a write-fence in the *middle* of a sequence of write
operations.  Doing an `fsync()` at the end can ensure that, if the
execution gets that far, the data stored is not lost; but it cannot
ensure that a power failure at some other point does not leave the
disk file in an inconsistent state.

A lot of the notes in Dercuano contain calculations. To take a random
example, file `lab-power-supply` says:

> It could maybe dissipate like 20W, which at 12V would be just 1.7
> amps…

> Supposing arbitrarily that I were to use a similar ATX power supply
> capable of 18A on its 12V output, which works out to 216W (a bit
> over a quarter horsepower), it would be nice to be able to carry
> that 216W most of the way down the range, say down to 2V — which
> would mean 108 fucking amperes.…

> How much energy do we need to store in the inductor at 62.5kHz?
> That’s 16 microseconds per cycle.  I’m a little unclear on exactly
> how the math of buck converters works out but I am pretty sure that
> it will not involve storing more than 16 microseconds’ worth of
> power in the inductor, which would be three or four millijoules, and
> I’m pretty sure it’s okay for the inductor current to fluctuate by
> 10% or so, maybe a lot more.  So if ½LI² = 4 mJ and I = 18 A, then L
> = 2·4 mJ / (18 A)² = 25μH,

> Refreshing at 1kHz (again, as suggested in the display datasheet)

These calculations are unfortunately “dead”, not “live” like the
calculations in a spreadsheet, and by the same token, they’re
time-consuming to verify — if you want to check to see if my
calculations are wrong, you need to enter each number into a
spreadsheet or calculator and redo the calculation from scratch.  I
typically use units(1) to do the calculations (as described in file
`executable-scholarship`) which reduces my chances of accidentally
dropping a “milli” or a “kilo” from the calculation, or using the
wrong conversion constants, but if you’re using Gnumeric or whatever,
you have to check those too.

And the calculations are just individual points, while the underlying
formula is a much richer interrelationship.  If you’re looking at the
½LI² formula above (see also file `dercuano-formula-display`) and you
wonder how high the inductance L would need to go to support 20 A of
current, you need to think about it for a while.  If you’re not used
to this kind of thing, the answer may require some square roots and
stuff.

Such calculations can be made “live” by generating them from some kind
of JS library that does calculations.  I’m thinking that something
like [my prototype RPN editor][0] could be developed into a
comfortable way of computing the quantities and displaying how they
were derived, although it does require a context switch from editing
plain text.

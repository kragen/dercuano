(In this version of the dontmove archival virtual machine, Aa input
and output a byte, Bb read the subtractor or subtract a number from
it, Cc read and write the word in memory in the Dd register, and Ee
read and write the program counter, the last of which leaves a return
address in the accumulator.  Somewhere I had a sort of "signum"
register but I forget where it is.)

I was thinking about how to do an assembler for dontmove, and I think
that the right thing to do is probably really a simple Forth compiler,
one that pastes together chunks of code with known stack effects.  If
we put the top of stack in Y, the down-counting stack pointer in X,
the down-counting return stack pointer in W, and the return address
(top of return stack) in V, assume Z is zero, and use U as a scratch
register, then DUP is "BbXbBbbZ1bBdxYc", for example, and DROP is
"BbZ1bBbbBuXdbBbbUbBxCy" or "BbXdbZ1bBbbBxCy".  Function calls are
similarly obnoxious; the actual function call itself is simply
something like "Z1234e", where 1234 is the address of the function;
and function entry is simply "v", and function exit is simply "Ve";
but before the call it is necessary to save V onto W, which is "WdVc",
and decrement W, which is the painful "ZbWbBbbZ1bBw"; and after the
return, restoring the previous V from W is also necessary.  (Perhaps
leaf functions could avoid that, and in other functions it could be
moved into the prologue and epilogue.)

(Note, there's lots of confusion in the code both above and below
about whether the pointers point to the last item pushed or the space
for the next one.)

If we had a way to simply set the contents of the subtractor, say "f",
rather than subtracting from it, then these would simplify
substantially, replacing lots of cases of "Bb...bBbb" with "...f".
Also let's suppose we have a premade -1 in, say, T, which we can set
up at some point with "Zf1bBt".

* DUP: "BbXbBbbZ1bBdxYc" -> "XfZ1bBdxYc"
* DROP: "BbZ1bBbbBuXdbBbbUbBxCy" -> "XfdTbBxCy"
* save V onto W and decrement W: "WdVcZbWbBbbZ1bBw" -> "WdfZ1bBwVc"
* restoring V from incremented W: "WfTbBwdCv"

(On second thought, it might make more sense not to keep
top-of-return-stack in a register; then non-leaf function entry is
something like "vWdfVcZ1bBw" and non-leaf function exit is
"WfTbBwdCe", needing no scratch register.  Without "f", non-leaf entry
is, for example, "vBbWdbBbbVcZ1bBw".  Leaf entry and exit can still be
"v" and "Ve".)

At some point you might get to questioning whether it's worth maybe
having increment and decrement instructions, distinct modes for
reading memory (add to accumulator, subtract from accumulator, XOR
with accumulator) but it doesn't take much to get to an abstract
machine that's more complicated than a GreenArrays core.

Forth "@" (memory fetch) is then "YdCy".  Store "!" is complicated by
needing to pop the stack twice: "XfdTbBxCsYdScXfdCyTbBx", or something
like that.  SWAP is easier due to the lack of arithmetic: "YuXdCyUd".
OVER, which pushes onto the stack, is something like
"XfdCuZ1bBxdYcUy".

If we had an increment instruction "+" that would increment the
accumulator instead of having "f", then store would become
"XdCsYdScX+d+xCy".  DUP, DROP, and function entry and exit would
similarly benefit from increment and decrement: "X-dxYc", "Xd+xCy",
"vW-dwVc", and "Wd+Ce" respectively.  This + and - completely
eliminate the need for "f" for these basic operations.

Forth "+" then would be "BbYbX-dxCbBbbBy" and Forth "-" is
"BbX-dxCbBbbYbBy".

Bitwise AND is going to be a real bear, involving a loop that shifts
bits to the left by adding a number to itself (something like
"BbYbbBbb") and then somehow getting the most significant bit.

This implies that we can probably do orders of magnitude better by
adding a NAND operation.  Say it was Gg, behaving like Bb: g NANDs the
input with what's already there, and you can read the result with G.
Now "Gg" NANDs the current result with itself, bitwise inverting it,
and "Zg" NANDs the current result with 0, setting it to all-1, which
also means that it will bit-invert the next thing we "g" into it.
Then we can AND registers Y and U with "ZgYgGgUgGgG": first putting
the bit-inversion of Y into G, then inverting that with Gg, then
NANDing U with Ug, inverting the result with anothe Gg, and then
getting it with G.  Similarly OR of U and Y becomes "ZgUgGuZgYgUgG", I
think.

The more I think about this, the more I wonder if something like
Calculus Vaporis is a better design.

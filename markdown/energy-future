In 2013, a momentous, revolutionary change, decades in the making,
came to pass, almost unnoticed.  Silicon solar photovoltaic energy
became cheaper than coal in much of the world.  Consequently, the
majority of world marketed energy will be solar by around 2020–2026,
and the problems humanity has to face will be completely different
thereafter.  Many things we think of as problems today will no longer
be problems, and many things we don't think of as problems yet will be
problems.

What does it mean for the cost to be lower?
-------------------------------------------

The cost of energy, particularly for power plants, is tricky to
calculate because the investments are long-term and often have
unforeseen consequences.  But energy utilities do these calculations
on a regular basis, depreciating investments in physical generation
infrastructure over XXX years and including cost of labor and fuel.

By these calculations, XXX in many parts of the world, utility-scale
solar photovoltaic energy is now cheaper than fossil-fuel energy.
This is new as of 2013.  It was never true before.

The major reason for this has been the precipitously dropping price of
silicon photovoltaic cells, due to an explosion of new low-cost
photovoltaic manufacturers in China.

In the case of solar energy plants, the fuel is free; the vast
majority of the cost of the energy is just the cost of building the
plant, much of which is the cost of the solar cells that went into it.

One of the significant expenses in photovoltaic cell production is
energy.  But cheaper photovoltaic cells will lower the price of solar
energy, which will lower the price of photovoltaic cells further.  The
ultimate limit is the cost of the raw materials and the depreciation
of the capital equipment needed to produce the cells in a lights-out
plant.  As explained below, the cost of the raw materials is extremely
low.

Some people have published calculations claiming that the embodied
energy of photovoltaic panels — that is, the amount of energy consumed
in their production — is greater than the amount of energy that the
panels produce over their lifetime, and therefore using fossil-fuel
energy to produce panels is just a waste.  This was probably correct
up to the 1980s, but the current energy payback time on photovoltaic
panels is probably around one year, while the panels are designed to
last 30 years, but in practice usually last longer.

What are the ultimate and practical limits to solar energy?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The "solar constant", the amount of sunlight that reaches Spaceship
Earth, is about 1400 watts per square meter above the atmosphere.  At
ground level, it's about 1000 watts per square meter, due to clouds,
dust, and air absorption at some wavelengths.  But that's a square
meter at right angles to sunlight, not parallel to the ground.
Tropical latitudes receive more sunlight because they're closer to
being at right angles to the sun, while areas near the poles receive
the least.

The total amount of sunlight striking the earth is XXX

Total world marketed energy consumption is XXX

You could imagine that even if the total amount of energy available is
very large, limitations on manufacturing capacity or raw materials
will limit us to harvesting a small fraction of it, as they have for
the past several million years.

Indeed, many solar energy technologies do have some limitations.
Thin-film panels invariably need indium, gallium, or both, although in
small amounts; these metals are already more precious than silver, and
they're mostly produced as a byproduct of zinc mining, so their supply
is very inelastic — the prices will have to go up a lot more before
people start opening indium and gallium mines.  (Substantial amounts
of indium could be recovered from discarded LCD panels if they can be
efficiently separated from the garbage stream.)  And germanium and
other exotic semiconductors used in high-end multijunction solar cells
are also rare.

But silicon photovoltaic cells, the current mainstream solar panel
technology, do not suffer from these problems.  They are principally
made of silicon, with aluminum conductive traces, and then doped with
trace amounts of group III and V elements such as phosphorus and
arsenic — all among the most common elements in Spaceship Earth's
crust.  Given sufficient energy and equipment, you could make silicon
photovoltaic panels out of almost any random rock, although perhaps at
a somewhat higher cost than using the currently popular ores.

Entire panels contain some additional elements: aluminum frames,
copper or aluminum wires, and tempered glass, which is made from
calcium, silicon, sodium, and oxygen, using fairly inexpensive
processes.

There's still the risk that, even if the raw materials intentionally
included in the solar panels are cheap, the capital equipment needed
to convert them into solar panels might be expensive.  For example,
parts of the manufacturing process involve melting silicon, which
requires very high temperatures, and typically platinum-iridium
crucibles.  Even if silicon is abundant, platinum and iridium are not.
I don't know enough to know if this risk will materialize, but if it
does, there is a lower-tech alternative: concentrating solar power.

The first solar power plant was built in 1908 (XXX?) in Egypt, and
used trough-shaped mirrors to focus sunlight on pipes, boiling water
to drive a steam engine.  This project ended when abundant oil was
discovered in the area, providing a cheaper source of energy, but now
that we've used up most of the oil, there are a number of similar
projects.

Steam engines do not need any scarce materials, either in the finished
engine or the factory to produce it, although they can be
substantially more efficient, up to 40%, if made using modern alloys.
And the mirrors for a concentrating solar power plant can be made from
aluminum and glass.  Current mirrors are made using a
vacuum-deposition process which makes them almost as cheap as plain
glass.  It's also possible to use Fresnel lenses molded from cheap
transparent plastic.

CSP doesn't gather sunlight on cloudy days, but it has the great
advantage that it is practical to use it to produce electricity at
night, by storing the gathered heat in tanks of molten nitrate salts.

An in-between option is what the famous Solyndra was pursuing: by
concentrating sunlight with mirrors or lenses, you can use a tiny
fraction of the photovoltaic cells that you'd need to gather the same
power directly from the sun, which in today's world may allow you to
use high-end multijunction cells with up to 40% efficiency, but in a
hypothetical world where platinum shortages limited photovoltaic
production, could substantially increase the installed power.
Solyndra went bankrupt because, at the moment, simple photovoltaic
cells are too cheap to compete with using complicated machinery that
needs to make back R&D costs.

How fast is adoption growing?
-----------------------------

Utility-scale solar photovoltaic installed capacity is currently
doubling every year in the US; recently worldwide capacity was
doubling every 22 months, but in early 2013 I saw figures that said
the doubling time had shortened to 8 months, presumably as a result of
the much lower costs.

I don't have any numbers for non-utility scale solar (e.g. on
rooftops) or other forms of solar energy (e.g. thin-film solar and
concentrating solar power), but I think it's safe to say that, for
now, utility-scale silicon photovoltaic has won the race and will
remain the cheapest way to harvest solar energy for the foreseeable
future.  The other forms are much smaller.

Specifically, [Intersolar reported in July][0] that new solar energy
installations (worldwide, I presume) would go from 30 GW of new
installed capacity in 2013 to 100 GW in 2014.  This represents a
doubling time of 8 months.

My prediction that this exponential growth will continue for another
decade and beyond is apparently a lunatic-fringe opinion; everybody
else I can find making plans or predictions about solar-energy growth
rates seems to be expecting something more like linear growth, to a
double-digit percentage of electric power supply only by the
mid-2020s.

What human problems exist because of energy scarcity?
-----------------------------------------------------

### Water shortages ###

Much has been said about the worldwide shortage of fresh water, with
predictions of wars being fought this century over it.  But salt water
is abundant, and production of fresh water from salt water can be
carried out straightforwardly with large energy inputs: either via
distillation, the traditional way, or by reverse osmosis, which uses
less energy. XXX Reverse osmosis plants do require significant
investment in equipment, but the majority of the cost of their water
is the cost of the energy they consume; and they are already cheap
enough to produce water to irrigate farmland, water pure enough that
it can reverse the problem of progressive salinization that has
desertified many previously-fertile lands that have been irrigated by
slightly salty water.

In short, fresh water is only scarce because energy is scarce.
Abundant energy will eliminate water scarcity and the risk of water
wars, except perhaps for landlocked countries.

### Expensive aluminum ###

Since Andrew Carnegie and his competitors exploited the Bessemer
process to make steel the mainstream material in the late 19th
century, our society has been girded with steel: steel railroad tracks
collapsing the price of transport, steel rebar holding our buildings
and bridges together, steel boats carrying our goods from port to
port, steel automobiles ferrying us from steel-framed building to
steel-framed building, where we can be shot by people with steel guns.

But the Hall-Héroult process, discovered in Carnegie's heyday, made
aluminum (previously a precious metal) into a lightweight, inexpensive
substitute, and it's displaced steel in some uses: airplanes, drink
cans, bicycles, engine pistons, and so on.  It's lighter than steel
for the same strength, and it doesn't rust.  Aluminum, however, is
still more expensive than steel per pound and even for a given
strength, so we continue using steel.

Most of the cost of the Hall-Héroult process, though, is the cost of
the energy it consumes to electrolyze the molten aluminum ore, an ore
which is abundant.  Abundant energy will make aluminum abundant too,
and it will displace steel in most applications; it will even displace
plastic in some.

### Climate control ###

Many of today's buildings, especially here in Argentina, are expensive
to inhabit because they were built in an age of energy abundance —
from the 1940s to the 1970s — and so are built with little concern for
efficiency of climate control, since operating air conditioners was
cheap at the time.  Many other buildings, like those in the world's
slums, are unpleasant and dangerous to live in because they don't have
adequate air conditioning or heating, and are not built with
sufficient resources to enable passive climate control.  (Vinay
Gupta's Hexayurt design is a possible alternative that provides
passive indoor climate control with much less resources than
traditional designs such as meter-thick adobe walls.)

Abundant energy makes it possible to heat and air-condition easily.

### Energy production centralization ###

Current electrical energy production is carried out in centralized
power plants, either because it's hydroelectric and therefore not
portable, because it's steam and therefore experiences great economies
of scale, or because it's nuclear and therefore is dangerous to
distribute widely.  About a third of it is then lost between the power
plant and the consumer, and sometimes inadequate infrastructure
maintenance results in widespread power outages, which are deadly.
This is okay if you have good governance, but in places with shitty
governance (like any slum, war zone, or refugee camp), it sucks.  It
also sucks if you have shitty self-discipline and blow your paycheck
on smack and booze instead of paying the electric bill.

Photovoltaic panels are portable, do not experience economies of scale
in use, and are not particularly dangerous.  They can substantially
ameliorate the problems of inadequately maintained electrical
transmission and distribution infrastructure, fragility in the face of
attack, and poor governance.

### Limited transportation ###

Much of the cost of transportation, especially air transportation but
even bus transportation, is the cost of the energy needed.  This cost
makes traveling an unachievable dream for much of the world's
population.

Airplanes, intercity buses, long-distance trains, and ships
universally use liquid fuel rather than batteries because of its much
higher energy density.  This has led to suggestions that solar energy
cannot replace fossil fuels for transport.  This is a mistake.  Liquid
fuels can be produced synthetically from CO₂ and water; it just takes
energy, and it's an inefficient process, so it won't happen until
electrical energy is *much* cheaper than fossil-fuel energy.

### Climate change ###

Global warming is caused by releasing fossil fuels into the
atmosphere, either burned or unburned, and by releasing carbon dioxide
from calcite in the production of cement.  With sufficiently-cheap
energy, cement production can be reoriented to magnesium cements
derived from seawater with no carbon emissions, and we can build
plants to actively remove carbon dioxide from air, either to sequester
it back underground or to reduce it into combustible material, as
suggested in the previous section.

What new human problems will exist because of energy abundance?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Dependence on energy suppliers; concentration of power in the hands of
those who control energy production.

Pollution.

Lack of menial labor.

What new human problems will exist because of solar photovoltaic energy?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can expect that a greater and greater proportion of our land area
will be consumed by solar panels, because building them on land is
easier than building them at sea.  At first, much of this will take
place in deserts, but eventually anyplace that gets sunlight will be
fair game.

Calories are a measure of energy; a food calorie is about 4200 joules.
The price of a joule in the form of food is similar to its price in
the form of electricity.  But solar panels are reducing that price,
and they turn a larger fraction of sunlight into usable energy than
natural photosynthesis does.  Typical silicon solar cells convert 16%
of incident sunlight into electricity, while the most efficient plants
convert 7% of incident sunlight into biomass energy XXX, which then
must be burned in a heat engine to recover some 2.8% of the original
energy.  So in the limit, an acre of solar cells will produce some
five times the usable energy of an acre of sugar cane.

So we can expect food crops, as well as nature reserves, to compete
with photovoltaic cells for land once the tropical deserts are used
up.  However, even with yearly doubling times, that won't happen until
the 2030s.  Before that, it will probably make more sense to plant
crops in the shadows of solar panels.  (Current practice, which I hope
stops, seems to be to concrete over the entire area to be populated
with solar panels.)

Historically, we have carried out only fairly small-scale
semiconductor fabrication, because it's an expensive process and
because integrated circuits can be very useful while still being
small.  XXX These small-scale processes nevertheless produced
staggering amounts of toxic waste, contaminating numerous sites around
the world.  To convert the world energy infrastructure to
photovoltaic, we will produce semiconductor wafers by the hectare,
with a correspondingly large possible increase in toxic waste.

While we won't have water wars, we probably will have wars for access
to tropical areas with low cloudiness, such as the Sahara and the
Atacama.

It hardly seems worth mentioning, but the Economist [predicts that
European utility companies may go bankrupt][2] when solar energy
lowers the price of energy below the cost of operation of their
existing fossil-fuel and nuclear plants; as a result, their market
capitalization has already dropped by half a trillion dollars. (!)

How is this practically different from biomass or agriculture?
--------------------------------------------------------------

As I mentioned above, current solar panels can collect some five times
the usable energy from sunlight that biomass and agriculture do.

How will solar abundance be distributed?
----------------------------------------

More tropically.  England's kind of fucked, as eloquently calculated
by David MacKay in [Sustainable Energy without the Hot Air][9], while
North Africa is sitting on a gold mine — but geopolitically lacks the
power to keep it from being exploited by other powers.

Should we conserve energy?
--------------------------

Yes, both because right now much of our energy produces CO₂ by burning
fossil fuels, causing global warming, and because energy is expensive.
Miners and drillers die to bring coal and uranium to your power plants
and gasoline to your cars.

Should we make long-term investments to reduce energy usage?
------------------------------------------------------------

No.  Marketed energy will become abundant in the mid-2020s.  An
efficiency investment that saves a dollar a year now will turn into
saving an inflation-adjusted dime or penny a year then.

Some people will do it anyway.  Here in Buenos Aires, I hear people
making arguments about how conserving fresh water is important, while
the Rio de la Plata a couple of kilometers away discharges 22000 cubic
meters per second of fresh water into the salty Atlantic (which is to
say, 600 000 liters per day per inhabitant of Buenos Aires), and every
construction pit in the city needs a sump pump to constantly pump
fresh groundwater out into the street.  They seem to be inspired by
the virtue of asceticism more than any actual knowledge about the
issues.

But in an energy-abundance regime, it will make as much sense to try
to conserve electricity by not using it as to try to conserve sunlight
by sitting in the shade instead of out on the beach.

How, where, and by whom are panels made today?

Different ways of buying energy, and their costs.

A pound of rice (453g) costs about US$0.35, or 0.08 cents per gram.
Each gram is about 5 kilocalories, or 21kJ, so in the form of rice,
you can get energy for about 27 megajoules per dollar.  If a
2000-calorie-per-day person got all their energy from rice (which
would result in dying of kwashiorkor) they would use 60 000 calories
in a month, or 12 kg of rice, or 26.5 lbs., which would cost US$9.27
at the above rate.

Vegetable oil is slightly cheaper as a source of calories, but it's in
more or less the same range.

Around here, gasoline currently costs about US$3.00 per gallon.  Each
gallon is about 130 megajoules, so in the form of gasoline, you can
get energy for about 43 megajoules per dollar.

Electricity in the US costs between US$0.06 and US$0.15 per
kilowatt-hour, with an average just under US$0.10.  A kilowatt-hour is
3.6 megajoules, so in the form of electricity, you can get energy for
about 36 megajoules per dollar.

These costs are surprisingly much more similar than I expected.

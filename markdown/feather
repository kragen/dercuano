The Adafruit Feather 32U4 seems like the modern successor to the
Arduino.  It has a slightly smaller form factor (22.9 mm × 50.8 mm),
comes with a LiPo battery-charging circuit, weighs 4.8 g, and it’s
based on the ATmega32U4 at 8 MHz at 3.3V.  This is a step down in
computational power, but also in power consumed.  But it has 20 GPIOs,
7 PWM pins, 10 analog inputs, a prototyping area, and its pin spacing
is breadboard- and perfboard-compatible; and it supports USB directly,
so you can directly do things like keyboards.

And of course it’s software-compatible with Arduino, although it’s
running at half the cock speed.

Instead of “shields”, the Feather has “wings”, which plug into
optional female headers you can solder on.  There are a few dozen
wings available, including things like Wi-Fi, OLED displays, etc.  I²C
is the primary means of communication between the Feather and its
Wings in order to get a limited amount of stackability.

There are also Feather base boards with other CPUs, apparently
including a Cortex-M0 with Wi-Fi (an ATSAMD21 and ATWINC1500, US$35),
a Cortex-M4, an ESP32 (“Huzzah32”, US$20), an ESP8266 (“Huzzah”,
US$17), and an STM32F205 with Wi-Fi (“WICED”, US$35).

Replacing fractional-reserve banking with a bond market disintermediated with a blockchain
==========================================================================================

I was reading [Jonathan Stray’s
account](http://jonathanstray.com/the-origin-of-banking) of Jon
Hicks’s possibly fictional 1989 account of the how banking and modern
money came to be, and it occurred to me that the bond market might be
an alternative to the borrow-short lend-long model of
fractional-reserve demand-deposit banking.

That is, if you have some money that you want to keep liquid but also
earn interest on, one possibility is to deposit it in a bank as demand
deposits.  The bank lends (most of) it out at higher interest, keeping
a small (“fractional”) reserve on hand in case some depositors show up
one day to close their accounts, and pays some (lower) interest to you
and the other depositors for the use of your money.  (Modern banks have
been able to mostly eliminate depositor interest, as their oligopoly
on payment systems, and in some case government regulations, obliges
people to deposit their money in banks even if they don’t earn
interest.)  The risk you take is that there might be a bank run — if
too many depositors show up demanding their demand deposits at once,
the first ones will get paid in full and the last ones will get their
share of whatever is left over from the bankruptcy.

Given the existence of a liquid trading market, bonds, such as
corporate bonds, might be a reasonable alternative.  Instead of
depositing your money in a bank account, you buy some bonds.  Instead
of withdrawing it, you sell the bonds on the market.  Bond prices go
up and down a bit — usually measured in basis points — and
occasionally companies will go bankrupt (or countries will go into
sovereign default) and again you’re just a bankruptcy creditor, but
you can diversify to minimize this risk.  Lending to companies is
overall mostly profitable, and the interest rates are higher than you
get with a checking account.

This is why money-market accounts are popular, but there’s no
fundamental reason that retail investment in the corporate-bond market
needs to be intermediated by banks or brokers; that’s just an artifact
of the limits of 20th-century information-processing technology.
Intermediating retail access to corporate bonds in this way just adds
risk — your bank or broker is far more likely to go bankrupt than the
entire basket of companies you lend to, and additionally they’re in a
position to cheat you in a variety of ways, including bucket-shop
tactics (that is, fractional-reserve banking, but in a way that is
illegal in the US), front-running, and paying bonuses to their
executives just before bankruptcy.

How would this differ in practice from a bank account?  Blue-chip
corporate and sovereign bonds typically fluctuate in value only by
basis points, so the chances of a significant loss of capital in this
way is fairly small, and you can diversify the risk across many
different debtors.  The big difference is what happens when there’s a
“bank run”: in the money market, those lenders who are most eager to
liquidate their holdings are often the ones who take the losses, while
in a demand-deposit bank run, the most eager lenders are the only ones
who get paid.  A temporary selloff in the bond market doesn’t directly
affect the companies whose bonds are being sold, unless they are
floating a new issue of bonds at that moment, which they usually
aren’t.  If the selloff is indeed temporary, rather than a result of
the debtor’s impending insolvency, those lenders who held during the
selloff will preserve their capital (the precise opposite of a bank
run), and those who risked buying the bargain-priced bonds are
rewarded.

In the modern commercial paper market, though, clearing of trades is
not instantaneous; the US corporate and municipal debt markets mostly
clear via DTC, the Depository Trust Company, which acts as a
counterparty to most transactions in corporate and municipal debt,
permitting settlement to be delayed for two days or longer.  As I
understand it, the London Clearing House’s EquityClear SA, despite its
name, plays a similar role in Europe.  Such clearing houses centralize
debt-transaction counterparty risk in much the same way that banks and
bank clearing houses centralize counterparty risk for cash
transactions; without clearing houses, buyers of debt would be taking
the risk that sellers would take the money and run without ever
handing over the bonds they were ostensibly selling.

Clearing house insolvency is a likely outcome of the next world war,
however, and represents the kind of systemic risk that it’s very
difficult to diversify away.

The obvious solution is to clear the trades with the Ethereum
blockchain or something similar, so that the transfer of debt title
from the seller to the buyer is a single atomic transaction with the
transfer of funds from the buyer to the seller.  This eliminates
counterparty risk from the bond markets as long as the blockchain’s
integrity remains secure.

The actual coupon payments on the bonds, or title to collateral to
secure those payments, *could* be incorporated into the same smart
contract, but this is much less essential — the lenders are at least
theoretically aware of who they’re lending to and assuming the risk
that that counterparty (the borrower, that is, the issuer of the
bonds) will default.  The whole purpose of the borrower issuing debt
in the first place is so that they can invest the money thus raised,
so you would expect that for most of the lifetime of the bond, they
won’t have an account with enough money in it to pay off the bond.  So
there’s little point in making the coupon payments nominally automatic
via a smart contract.

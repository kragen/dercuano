Gradient descent and friends are widely used in machine learning.  The
basic recipe is that you have some statistical model which contains
some parameters, and you use gradient descent to set the parameters
to, hopefully, minimize the prediction error.

This is an extremely useful approach, and you could argue that, even
by itself, it’s revolutionary.  But gradient descent is useful for
other things that don’t fit into this model.  Gradient descent is a
general continuous optimization procedure; it can be used to
approximate a local minimum of any differentiable function, and it
scales well to large numbers of dimensions.

Let’s unpack this a little bit.  In the standard ML approach, you have
a MODEL which, given PARAMETERS and INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, produces a
PREDICTION of some DEPENDENT VARIABLES with some amount of ERROR.  You
use gradient descent, or some related algorithm, to try to set the
PARAMETERS to minimize the ERROR.  And you have to worry about whether
you’re overfitting, and so you use a training set and a test set to
see if the model is starting to overfit your training data.

But gradient descent doesn’t know anything about predictions or
overfitting or the dependent and independent variables of your model.
From gradient descent’s point of view, the model and training set
(including dependent and independent variables) are just part of a
LOSS FUNCTION which, given INPUTS, produces an error or LOSS.

Gradient descent is a somewhat general procedure for finding the
inputs that minimize such loss functions.

It turns out that there are a lot of other things in the world that
can be represented in this way.  There are a lot of things you might
want to minimize that are not prediction errors.

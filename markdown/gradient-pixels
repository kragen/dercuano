Color computer displays in the 1980s and 1990s used a “palette” of
colors to save memory, so that they could use only a single byte per
pixel instead of the 2–4 bytes needed by the “TrueColor” displays we
use nowadays, which did exist at the time but were specialty high-end
hardware, used only for things like making movies.  The “palette” was
a finite array of colors that the pixels in the framebuffer indexed
into.

But what if we’d used a different approach, one more driven by the
capacities of the human visual system and of electronics?  I think we
could have done about an order of magnitude better for photos and
video.

Before palettes
---------------

Prior to paletted framebuffers, computer displays commonly used
character generators.  A color 80×25 terminal with 8×16 characters has
256 000 pixels, but might have only 4000 bytes of RAM (one byte of
character data and one byte of colors for each of the 2000 screen
cells), and video cards for personal computers followed a similar
approach.  As the electron beam scanned across the screen, the
hardware would read out the appropriate line of pixels from the
appropriate glyph in the font — at first in ROM, later RAM, allowing
runtime-changeable fonts, at the cost of another 4096 bytes of RAM.
Systems like the Nintendo used a similar tile system, adding features
for “sprite” overlays, which many home computers also had.

Typically, this approach required fixed-width fonts, although that
wasn’t really a necessary restriction.  Later character-generator-
driven systems like the DEC VT220 (and maybe the VT100?) often
supported double-width and double-height characters, providing a
little bit of typographical variety.

Game computers of the time had different specialized hardware with
sprites and some compositing built in;
<https://prog21.dadgum.com/181.html> talks a bit about how the Atari
2600 in 1977 managed to do NTSC-resolution video games with 128 bytes
of RAM, and <https://prog21.dadgum.com/173.html> talks about the
slightly later Atari 800.

By contrast, the original Macintosh shipped with 128 kibibytes of RAM
(because 512 kibibytes was thought to be too expensive) and had a
512×342 one-bit framebuffer, which requires 22 kilobytes of RAM, five
times as much as the fixed-font character generator and three times as
much as the variable-font character generator, and it couldn’t fit as
much readable text on the screen and couldn’t do color.

The advent of the palette
-------------------------

The IBM EGA (in 1984), the Apple IIGS VGC (in 1986), the IBM VGA (in
1987), and a large variety of other systems in the late 1980s and
early 1990s instead adopted a “paletted” approach, in which a small
number of bits per pixel in the framebuffer indexed into a palette.
The EGA had 4 bits per pixel and 6 bits per palette entry, the VGC had
4 bits per pixel and 12 bits per palette entry, and the VGA had 8 bits
per pixel and 18 bits per palette entry.

Let’s consider a 1024×768 Super VGA, common around 1990, with its
traditional 256-color palette (with 6 bits per color channel).  At the
standard 72 dpi, that’s 361×271 mm, a “17.8 inch” monitor, while on a
more affordable 12.8-inch monitor it would hit 100 dpi.  And it could
display pretty decent photos, although a lot of software fuckery went
into palette handling and dithering, especially once you got into
windowed displays and animation; the grainy look of GIF video nowadays
comes from the 256-color-palette limitation that it inherited from the
video hardware of that period.

These displays could also do pretty decent text: in a readable but
jaggy 5×8 font, you would get 96 lines of 204 columns on the screen,
but a more easily readable 8×12 pixel font would give you 64 lines of
128 columns.  That’s a bit more than a printed A4-size page of text.

The palette meant that such SVGA cards could ship with only 768
kilobytes of DRAM.  DRAM cost US$40 per megabyte from about 1992 to
about 1996, due to a price-fixing cartel which eventually collapsed,
and so this was US$30 worth of RAM — even more in 1990 or 1988.  A
16-bit TrueColor display in the now-popular 5-6-5 RGB format would
have cost US$30 more to make and had one bit less color precision in
red and blue; a display at this resolution like the Targa, with the
24-bit TrueColor that is now universal except on low-end cellphones,
would cost US$60 more to make.

Alternate history: gradient tiles or gradient pixels
----------------------------------------------------

But let’s consider different tradeoffs you could have made.  Suppose
that, instead of 1024×768 pixels, the screen were divided into 192×144
tiles, each 1.88 mm square on a 17.8" monitor, and each tile could
display two arbitrary linear gradients, separated by a diagonal line
at an arbitrary angle and position.  Suppose the start color and ∇
(dr/dx, dr/dy, dg/dx, dg/dy, db/dx, db/dy) for each gradient are
specified to 8 bits per channel, and 4 bits each specify the angle and
the position of the dividing line, so the angle is specified with a
resolution of 11°15', and the position is specified with a precision
of, say, 118 μm if the line is vertical or 166 μm if the line is
diagonal.

This gives us about 3× the linear spatial resolution of the 1024×768
display and 4× its color resolution on each channel (assuming the
analog parts of the system are adequate), but subject to some
significant lossy compression.  In particular, text is going to have
to be pretty large.

Let’s add up the memory per tile here:

    |                        | bytes/tile |
    | gradient 1 start color |          3 |
    | gradient 1 ∇           |          6 |
    | gradient 2 start color |          3 |
    | gradient 2 ∇           |          6 |
    | dividing line          |          1 |
    | total                  |         19 |

So that gives us 525 kilobytes or 513 kibibytes of VRAM, instead of
the 768 KiB of VRAM we need for the SVGA.

You could do the whole decoding process from the gradient tiles to
voltages entirely digitally, feeding digital counts to a DAC according
to a dot clock, just like a normal video card.  But you could actually
get smoother gradients with much slower hardware if you generate the
gradients with *analog* circuitry, consisting of a capacitor C1
connected through a buffer to each output channel, connected to a
transmission gate and a voltage-controlled current source controlled
by another capacitor C2, which is itself connected to another
transmission gate.  Each time you cross a tile boundary or a diagonal
line, you short both C1 and C2 to voltages at the outputs of a couple
of buffers driven by capacitors C3 and C4, which are
sampling-and-holding outputs from a previous conversion result from a
DAC.  The diagonal-line trigger is driven from a timer which is also
set by a DAC at tile-boundary-crossing time.

Supposing we have 768 visible scan lines and thus about 850 total scan
lines in an 85-Hz frame, our horizontal scan frequency is about
72 kHz; if we have 210 “gradient tile times” per scan line (including
10% HBI) then our “gradient tile clock” is only 15.2 MHz.  Under the
same assumptions, the 1024×768 traditional display needs an 82 MHz dot
clock.  However, the jitter constraint on the gradient tile display is
actually substantially tighter if we are to achieve the promised 3×
spatial resolution improvement, and of course each color channel needs
four DAC conversions per tile clock (initial value, initial partial
derivative in X, and both of these after crossing the edge), so the
DAC actually must run at almost the same speed.

This isn’t quite as terrible as it might seem for text if the gradient
saturates when it reaches a max or min value, as it would in the
suggested analog embodiment; with a background that’s either black or
white, that allows us to get a vertical line at the left edge of each
tile and a diagonal line at the edge, simply by setting the gradient
value large enough to rapidly saturate to the background color after
the crossing.  I estimate that you could get readable (fixed-width)
text with 2×2 gradient tiles per character cell, which would give us
72 lines of 96 columns, in the same ballpark as the SVGA card.

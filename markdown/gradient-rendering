Dave Long pointed out that two overlapped alpha-blended linear

More recently, it occurs to me that there is a potential problem with
precision here, but it can be overcome.  If we want to be able to make
a linear gradient from any given 24-bit color to any other given
24-bit color across some horizontal distance, then we need to support
a change of a single count across that distance. If our intermediate
results are only 48 bits (16 bits per color plane), then the furthest
we can reach without missing is 256 pixels horizontally.  (In a sense,
the other 8 bits per pixel hold a fractional color or error
accumulator.)

This suggests that the optimal way to do this thing is to render
things in 256×1 chunks, with the buffer occupying 1536 bytes.
Alternatively, you could do it a scan line at a time with 32-bit ints,
which would work properly as long as the scan lines were shorter than
2²⁴ pixels, but this requires more buffer space and also runs half as
fast with optimal SIMD instructions.  For example, a 2048-pixel scan
line would require 12288 bytes of buffer space, big enough to put
serious pressure on the L1D cache.  (I’m writing this on an Atom with
a 24 KB 6-way set associative write-back L1D cache, for example.)

It might turn out to be work more effectively with current SIMD
instruction sets to render a band of several scan lines at a time,
because the vertical SIMD instructions have better coverage of the
available space.  For example, using AVX-512 instructions, you could
maybe handle 32 scan lines in each instruction, or maybe one color
plane for each of 10 scan lines, thus rendering a 256×10 or 256×32
band.  I think that with AVX-512 and four-way loop unrolling, the
inner loop of the critical prefix sum there will take probably 320
cycles; if it’s 256×10, that would be 8 pixels per cycle, or 4 pixels
per cycle if you do it twice.  Repainting a 2048×1536 screen that way
will take about 786432 cycles, plus whatever overhead is needed to set
up the gradient stops and copy the finished pixels into the
framebuffer and whatnot.

(AVX2 and AVX-512 support gather load with the VGATHERDPS, VGATHERDPD,
etc., instructions, as well as permuting stuff within a register with
VPERMPS, VPERMD, PSHUFB, etc., so copying the finished pixels into the
framebuffer might not be the horrible performance nightmare you might
expect.  AVX-512F also has scatter store.)

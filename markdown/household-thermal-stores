Today is 2018-11-16.  My house here in Buenos Aires has another power
outage, an event which happens regularly during the summer months.
They think power will be restored in some four hours, but this is
uncertain.  On one occasion a few years ago, I had a three-week power
outage.

(Note: in fact, as I wrote this, the power came back and stayed on.)

The first thing I did was to check the refrigerator and put ice into
it.  So I was thinking about the sizes of the thermal stores that
would be needed for the various temperature-control applications of
electrical energy that I had been suddenly denied.

Refrigerators
-------------

In preparation for such events, I have some soft-drink bottles filled
with water and frozen in the freezer, to absorb heat through their
enthalpy of fusion, and more soft-drink bottles filled with water and
chilled in the refrigerator, to provide thermal mass.  When there’s a
power outage, I move ice bottles from the freezer into the fridge.

Unfortunately, my refrigerator is not a super-efficient model like the
Sun Frost line; it’s a rather normal refrigerator with a compressor, a
magnetic-strip gasket, and a few centimeters of foam between the
inside and outside walls.  I’ve scoured it in vain for information
about its energy-efficiency, except that it claims its nominal power
is 230 watts, and it uses 180 watts to defrost the freezer and 15
watts for the light.  Let’s assume that 230 watts is the maximum
power, but that it doesn’t run the compressor and the defroster at the
same time, so the compressor uses 215 watts.  And, although I haven’t
measured this, the compressor needs to run somewhere around half the
time.  (This is normal.  If your compressor needs to run 80% of the
time or more to keep the fridge cold at normal ambient temperatures,
you’re in danger of going over the temperature setpoint and spoiling
your food if it warms up a bit outside, say from 20° to 24°, and so
compressors are sized to prevent this.  But if your compressor only
needs to run 20% of the time, you could have used a compressor half
the size, and the fridge would be a lot cheaper.)

So let’s say the compressor averages 110 watts at normal ambient
temperatures, and let’s suppose it has a coefficient of performance of
2, which is a normal kind of coefficient of performance for
refrigeration systems.  That means it draws off 200 watts of heat from
the food within, on average, to compensate for the heat leakage
through the walls and the seals and the losses when the door is opened
and all the cold air falls out.  (The bottles in the fridge also serve
a bit to reduce the air losses.)  And that means that those leakages
are about 220 watts.

The enthalpy of fusion of ice is about [333 kJ/kg][6], so 220 W is
about 660 mg/s of melting ice, which works out to 57 kg/day
(19 MJ/day).  I don’t have 57 kg of ice in there.  I have the
following bottles:

    | N |     ℓ |  total |
    |---+-------+--------|
    | 1 |  2.25 |   2.25 |
    | 3 |  1.25 |   3.75 |
    | 2 |   0.6 |    1.2 |
    | 8 |   0.5 |     4. |
    | 1 |  .375 |  0.375 |
    |   | total | 11.575 |
    #+TBLFM: $3=$1*$2::@7$3=vsum(@2$3..@6$3)

So I have about 11.6 kg of ice in there, which works out to about 4.9
hours.  Whew, that’s not much!  And I guess that’s why old-fashioned
iceboxes worked on a basis of daily door-to-door ice delivery.

Wrapping the refrigerator in a blanket might help the situation.  But
another possible solution would be a coolth reservoir where I actually
could store 50 kg or more of ice, frozen when there’s power and used
for cooling when there’s not.  It could be relatively small, and
indeed to keep the power costs acceptable it would need to be
relatively small and relatively well insulated.

Dehydrators
-----------

At Burning Man, where you need to either burn or haul away any garbage
you generate, down to the smallest fern leaf, we dehydrated our
garbage by hanging it out in the dry wind in a net bag; this prevented
it from rotting while we were there, improved its qualities as fire
fuel, and reduced its weight enormously for the trip back.  Though
this is rarely done in the US, the same procedure is commonly used to
dry clothes after washing them, though usually without the bag.  And
of course this is a common way to preserve sliced produce as well.

Putting air in contact with moist things causes the humidity in some
surface layer of air to reach 100% (in the case of pure water) or
whatever the equilibrium relative humidity of the solution is (when it
has solutes such as salts).  Water can diffuse across this layer into
other air, or you can blow the surface layer away and replace it with
new air, and in either case you remove water from the vicinity of the
moist thing and increase the drying rate.

The amount of moisture required to reach 100% humidity rises
exponentially with air temperature, doubling about every 10½°, so by
raising the temperature of the air a few degrees, you can get very
substantial increases in the drying rate.  This is complicated by the
fact that the evaporation itself cools down the air and the moist
thing, and so your surface temperature is always a bit lower than the
incoming air temperature; after a short while, the heat thus absorbed
is necessarily replaced by the heat in the incoming air.

The principal difficulty with dehydrators is that they have to work
relatively fast to be useful, and this requires the air to be both
hot, which requires a lot of energy, and fast-moving, which requires a
bit of energy but mostly careful airflow design.  There’s the
additional difficulty that, if you’re heating things up with fire or
electricity, you need a thermostat, and ideally one that turns the
heat off if it fails, rather than unexpectedly setting fire to things
and melting things.

The [enthalpy of vaporization of water is 2.26 MJ/kg][e], an enormous
number, and it swamps the specific heat of air or vapor, so nearly all
of the energy that goes into the dehydator is used to evaporate water.

[e]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_vaporization

Here, I’ve been using my electric oven to dehydrate garbage.  The oven
has a thermostat that goes down to 50°, and also a fan and a shutoff
timer.  So far, the thermostat has been dependable, but I’m not sure
that it’s designed to fail safe; the shutoff timer fails when there’s
a power outage (as I said before, a frequent event), and in those
cases the oven turns back on when power is restored.  This is
unacceptable and so I cannot depend on the shutoff timer.

(Ideally a dehydrator would be driven by a humidistat and would shut
off when the desired humidity was reached.)

Depending on what you’re dehydrating, different temperatures may be
acceptable, and clothes dryers are designed with a relatively
sensitive thermostat for precisely this reason — the high heat that
most quickly dries cotton clothes would be disastrous for delicate
synthetics.  35° is a fairly safe temperature for anything other than
certain exotic materials you probably shouldn’t be playing with
anyway.  Raw-foodists require their food not to be heated above 42°
for somewhat debatable nutritional reasons.  75° is generally
considered adequate for sterilizing food; although there are a few
exotic thermophile microbes that can survive higher temperatures, they
are not active at 37° (the temperature they are at after you eat them)
and so they are generally not pathogenic.  Some common plastics,
especially PET — the polyester used for both cloth and Coke
bottles — soften and change shape above 90°, and in my oven I’ve
observed dried egg whites browning somewhere in the 70°–90° range.
Water, of course, boils at 100°.  Wood starts to brown around that
temperature, too, though the autoignition temperature of paper is 233°
according to Bradbury.

Using the psychrometic exponential rule of thumb, even at 35°, you
evaporate water almost 3× as fast as at 20°, and at 75° you evaporate
it 38× as fast.  Furthermore, the same air heated to 75° has 38× lower
relative humidity, so if the relative humidity is 70% outside, it’s 2%
in the dehydrator.  This means not only that you can dry things
faster, but also that you can dry things that wouldn’t dry at all in
room-temperature air, because they have enough salt or other
hygroscopic substance in them that they’re already in equilibrium.

Predicting the exact drying rate is very complicated, because it
depends not only on the rather complicated diffusion and advection
processes I mentioned above, but also on airflow patterns, specimen
thickness, humidity diffusion rate through the specimen, salinity, and
the presence of other hygroscopic substances.  But usually, in my oven
at its nominal uncalibrated 75°, my tens-of-millimeters-thick food
garbage dries out satisfactorily in an hour or two.

How much energy does this require?  100 g of food garbage (orange
peels, chicken bones, outer onion layers, food particles washed off
dishes, and whatnot) might be a meal’s worth, assuming you don’t let
food rot.  Say that’s 75% water, so 75 g of water.  That’s 170 kJ at
2.26 MJ/kg.  Air’s fairly low specific heat of 1.01 kJ/kg/K means that
putting 170 kJ into heating air from 20° to 75° means you need to heat
about 3 kg of air to deliver that energy; at 1.2 kg/m³, that’s 2.5 m³
of air you need to pass over the meal’s worth of food, or 510 kJ or
7.5 m³ per person per day, 5.9 W.  You might need to double that if
some food goes bad.  It’s still a factor of 20 to 40 smaller than the
reservoir you need for the refrigerator.

In a situation of a prolonged outage of municipal services,
dehydration is probably also a reasonable weapon to have in your
arsenal against food decay, corpse decay, and feces, although if
you’re going to be dehydrating feces with hot air you probably want to
use a separate dehydrator from the food dehydrator, and you might also
want to use some kind of scrubber on the output air to keep the smell
down.  (This in turn suggests you might want to use a closed-loop
system like the one modern condensing clothes dryers use.)  Dehydrated
feces can be burned, stored, or more easily composted than fresh
feces, especially diarrhea, and if you can sterilize them in the
process, all the better.

Cooking
-------

My stove is, unfortunately, electric.  Cooking a meal involves,
minimally, heating the food to the right temperature and holding it at
that temperature until it’s cooked.  The temperature is invariably
between 40° and 100°.  Some meats can be cooked _sous vide_ at
temperatures as low as 60°, at least once they’re sterilized, but many
vegetables require 90°.  Kidney beans in particular are dangerously
poisonous if cooked below about 95°.XXX

The traditional means for holding the food at the right temperature is
to continuously apply heat to it, while it’s losing heat to the
environment by another route, so that the thermal equilibrium is
around the desired cooking temperature, but other approaches are
possible; for example, you can use a thermos or hooikist to maintain
the temperature passively, or a thermostat together with some
insulation to maintain it more actively, as crockpots, _sous vide_
cookers, and my oven do.

Typically a meal’s worth of food for a person is about 500 g, and it’s
largely water, with a specific heat in the neighborhood of water’s.
Heating it from 20° to 80° thus requires 20 kilocalories, 84 kJ, which
is 2 minutes in a 700-watt microwave oven at full power.  Thermal
losses might push the energy required higher, perhaps to 150 kJ.
Three meals a day then require 450 kJ per person per day, or 5.2 W,
very close to the 510 kJ required to dehydrate the food garbage.

Indoor climate control
----------------------

Due to deplorable construction techniques, a refrigerative air
conditioner of 2000 watts or more is necessary in many Buenos Aires
apartments to maintain the temperature at bearable levels.  2000 watts
of input produces about 4000 watts of heat removal (CoP ≈ 2), but
typical duty cycles are about ⅓ on a 24-hour basis, meaning that you
only need to remove 1300 watts on average (115 MJ/day).  Typical set
points are in the 18°–26° range; 24° is about the most I can take.

Ice vests
---------

Workers in very hot environments, such as some parts of power plants,
often use ice vests, which either have ice packets in the vest or
coolant tubes in the vest running to an ice backpack containing some
phase-change material at or below 20°, typically water ice at 0°.
This allows you to shunt the 100 W or so of heat that your body
produces into the ice rather than finding a way to reject that heat
into a hostile environment.  If you are adequately insulated, that 100
W, or up to 2000 W if you’re exercising hard enough, is all the ice
vest needs to absorb.

Usually ice vests are used for short stints, like an hour or two, but
an ice vest that could last 8–12 hours would be very useful in the
Buenos Aires summer.  An hour at 100 W is 360 kJ, or a bit over 1 kg
of ice, so a 12-hour ice vest would require about 13 kg of ice, which
would be an uncomfortably heavy backpack.

As an alternative to indoor climate control, an ice vest with easily
interchangeable ice packs, or even that you could leave plugged into a
flexible coolant line as you move around your apartment, could be
lightweight, and it would require less energy than air conditioning,
since it would only need to absorb the heat produced by your body, not
the sunlight flooding in through the windows or the hot air seeping in
under the door.

Showering
---------

The building has a central electric hot-water system with a huge
stainless steel tank, so my hot water didn’t actually go out during
this power cut, but it would during a longer cut.  My shower delivers
about 250 mℓ/s of water at typically about 40°, but needs to be able
to reach 45°; further temperature range is undesirable, as water above
45° can scald you before you can react.  I typically shower for about
half an hour a day, which is perhaps longer than most people, and
works out to about 450 ℓ of fresh water that would have otherwise
flowed unmolested past Buenos Aires into the Atlantic, where it turns
brackish in the estuary of the Rio de La Plata.

450 ℓ of water at ΔT = 25 K is 47 MJ per person per day, or about
540 W.

Summary of thermal energy needs
-------------------------------

So here are the controlled heat flows per person, with a per-day
average.  This is not the electrical energy, but the thermal energy.

    | Use              | W (avg) | MJ/day | target |         |
    | Air conditioning |    1300 |    115 | 20°    | cooling |
    | Refrigerator     |     220 |     19 | 4°     | cooling |
    | Ice vests        |     100 |    8.6 | 20°    | cooling |
    | Showering        |     540 |     47 | 45°    | heating |
    | Cooking          |     5.2 |   0.45 | 100°   | heating |
    | Dehydration      |     5.9 |   0.51 | 75°    | heating |
    | total            |  2171.1 | 190.56 |        |         |
    #+TBLFM: @8$2..@8$3=vsum(@2..@7)

So the first thing to notice is that air conditioning actually
accounts for 60% of the total, and the problem gets substantially
easier if we can eliminate it, for example with ice vests or better
building envelope design.  The second thing to notice is that the
high-temperature heat applications are very low-volume, while the
high-volume heat application, showering, is very low-temperature.

Possible reservoirs
-------------------

What combination of thermal reservoir designs could we use to satisfy
these needs?  We can use thermal mass or phase-change materials, and
we can recharge the reservoirs from different sources of heat and
cold.

We can consider the hot reservoirs and cold reservoirs separately,
because they are 

### Cool reservoirs ###

Although ice vests could in theory use a higher-temperature
phase-change material, you pretty much need water ice in even larger
volumes for food refrigeration, and probably any other phase-change
material would be both more massive and more expensive.  So it’s
probably best to just use ice for the phase-change cool reservoir.
28 MJ of ice is 84 kg of ice per day, of which 8.6 MJ or 26 kg is for
your ice vest; a week’s store of ice would be 590 kg, almost a cubic
meter.  This is a substantial-sized home appliance, especially with
the extra volume needed for cooling extra people.

The difficulty with water ice is that you need something below 0° to
get it, unless perhaps you make clathrates or something at a slightly
higher temperature.  Although some very dry places do reach such
temperatures during the night — and you might be able to do a bit
better still with reflective optics and some evaporative
cooling — here in Buenos Aires, this pretty much requires active
refrigeration, either with a compressor or some other form of
refrigeration, like a vortex tube or an ammonia-absorption
refrigerator.

(An ammonia-absorption refrigerator powered by solar thermal energy is
quite a reasonable possibility.)

But it’s quite common for the temperatures to reach cool and even
chilly levels during the night; as I write this, for example, it’s 18°
outside.  If you could accumulate a large mass of 18° material during
the night, for example by passing night air through it, you could use
that for indoor climate control during the day, even if not directly
for food refrigeration.  But how much mass would you need?

Supposing that it’s in the form of water bottles at 18°, which you
then allow to warm up to 23° as you pass air over them in order to
sink the undesired daytime heat.  To compare apples to apples, we’ll
suppose we’re using this to cool your no-longer-ice vest rather than
to air-condition your house, so we only need 8.6 MJ.  But 8.6 MJ /
((23 - 18) calorie / g) = 410 kg instead of the 26 kg for the
corresponding ice.  (The other 58 kg were for cooling food down to 4°,
for which the 18° water would be counterproductive.)  Cooling the
410 kg of water back down at night involves passing at least 8.6 MJ /
(5 K · 1.01 kJ/kg/K) = 1700 kg = 1400 m³ of 18° air over them.  That’s
66 ℓ/s or 139 cfm if you do it in the 6 coolest hours, which is a
quite feasible airflow rate, but one that will require forced air in
any reasonably-sized system.

If you have a phase-change material that changes phase at a
temperature between 18° and 23°, you could use that instead, and maybe
you could get it down to 50 kg or something.  Unfortunately, the only
things I’m aware of that fits the bill is certain expensive grades of
paraffin and some outrageously expensive metals.

The potential advantage of using a second cool reservoir at a more
moderate temperature is that you can replenish it in relatively simple
ways, like with a box fan running at night, rather than a compressor
or vortex tube or something.  But it’s probably not worthwhile, since
you need the larger, colder cool reservoir for food preservation
anyway.

### Hot reservoirs ###

On the other hand, the system should almost certainly use separate
reservoirs for heat: one for the ≈1 MJ daily of cooking and
dehydration heat at 100°, and another one for the ≈50 MJ daily of hot
water at 45°.  Both of these temperatures can be easily obtained from
solar thermal energy; the equilibrium radiation temperature of “one
sun” is 94°, which is to say that thin things on Earth’s surface only
fail to reach 94° when they’re at right angles to sunlight because
they have air blowing around to cool them off, and “two suns” — the
intensity of sunlight you get from direct sun plus a flat
mirror — gets you to 163°.  Anything up to “ten suns”, which would get
you to 379°, is considered a “low solar concentration ratio” and is
easily achieved.

#### Small high-temperature reservoir ####

If we have to gather the 11.1 W of cooking and dehydration heat during
6 hours of sun exposure — a reasonably pessimistic figure — then we
need 44 W during that time, which is 0.044 m², a 210-mm-square area.
In order to be able to cook and dehydrate at other times of day, we
need to transfer the heat from the absorber (which is of a size
somewhere less than 0.04 m² to achieve the required temperature, and
somewhere larger than 0.004 m² so that the optics aren’t too
complicated) to some kind of reservoir.  Bricks, for example, or sand.
The easiest way to move this heat around is with some kind of coolant,
and the easiest one that has no trouble with temperatures from 20° to
a bit over 100° is air.

If we add a bit of pad, let’s suppose that the reservoir itself is at
120° when full and stores 3 MJ of heat that are released when it cools
down to 100°, at which point we consider it “exhausted”.  Storing 3 MJ
in 20 K of ΔT in a material with, say, 1 J/g/K, means that it needs
about 150 kg of active mass, say about 1500 ceramic tiles of 100 g
each, which will occupy on the order of 0.15 m³ of volume including
air spaces between them.  This will have on the order of 1.5 m² of
surface area around it through which it can lose heat to the
environment with its ΔT of about 90 K above ambient.  We’d like it to
lose no more than, say, 1 MJ during 18 hours when it’s not warming up,
which is a rather demanding 15 W or so, 9 W/m², or 0.1 W/m²/K.  It’s
probably not safe to use organic insulators like polyisocyanurate,
styrofoam (33 mW/m/K; see file `deep-freeze`), or straw (90 mW/m/K) at
these temperatures, but fiberglass should be fine.  I don’t have
fiberglass’s insulance handy, but let’s say it’s 50 mW/m/K.  Then you
need 500 mm of fiberglass around your thermal reservoir to reach such
a demanding specification.  This is somewhat unreasonable.

So let’s add a lot more pad.  Let’s let our reservoir be at 200° when
full and store 20 MJ of heat by cooling down to 100°.  Now it needs to
be 200 kg, which would be a cube 58 cm on a side at 1 g/cc, with a
surface area of 2.1 m².  Say we can afford to lose 16 MJ (leaving
4 MJ) during 18 hours, which is 250 W (better not keep it indoors in
the summer) at a ΔT of 130 K, which works out to 120 W/m² and
0.9 W/m²/K.  (50 mW/m/K) / (250 W / 130 K / 2.1 m²) = 55 mm of
fiberglass insulation, which is eminently feasible, comparable to what
my refrigerator uses.

You can’t, of course, support 200 kg of tile or whatever on 580×580 mm
of fiberglass and maintain the fiberglass’s insulance.  But you can
suspend the mass in a frame in the middle of the fiberglass, hanging
it by metal wires.  1mm-diameter music wire would in theory be enough,
but probably more like 8 such wires would be advisable to keep the
suspended frame from shifting around and opening gaps in the
fiberglass.

If you can use a phase-change material with a transition temperature
between 100° and 200°, you might be able to simultaneously reduce the
mass, and the volume, the working temperature of the reservoir, the
variability of the temperature, and the surface area through which
heat is lost.  Alkali nitrates and typemetal occur to me as
possibilities.

Peak shaving and TOU metering
-----------------------------

Some electrical utilities, like PG&E in California, are [introducing
time-of-use metering][7], where they charge you more for electricity
used during "peak" hours than during "off-peak" hours.  While this is
still a long shot from true demand response, it should create a market
for appliances such as refrigerators

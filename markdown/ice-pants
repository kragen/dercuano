Some people have serious difficulty with some naturally occurring
levels of heat.  The CEO of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, has credited air
conditioning with allowing his (tropical) country to develop
economically; and in recent years, as I age, I find myself suffering
increasing levels of impairment and ill-being from the Buenos Aires
summer.  But air conditioning has some disadvantages.  It requires
large, capital-intensive machinery; it consumes a lot of energy to
cool large spaces, and a lot of power to cool spaces with a lot of
surface area to a hot outdoors; and it isn’t portable to many places
people would like to go.

Years ago I read [a 2007 Mother Jones article by Dennis Gaffney about
hypermilers][0] in which the protagonist, Wayne Gerdes, sometimes
wears an “ice vest”, “which he uses at the nuclear plant when he has
to work in really hot rooms,” because, says Wayne, “You can drive at
95 degrees [Fahrenheit; 35°] with an ice vest, and it doesn’t feel
like 95 [35°]....  No electricity, no air, no fans.”

Also in 2007, my then wife, Beatrice, was suffering from the Buenos
Aires summer heat in our house.  I don’t remember if we didn’t yet
have an air conditioner in the bedroom, or if it wasn’t powerful
enough, or if the power was going out, but she took to freezing
plastic bottles in the freezer and wrapping them in a towel to snuggle
up to at night, a trick which I’ve used to great effect ever since.

What if you had an optimized, portable version of this?  Could you
eliminate the need for air conditioning?  What would such a design
look like?

I think I want one of these for daily use.

Rough calculations and background
---------------------------------

An adult human normally must consume about 2000 to 2500 kcal per day
(8.5–10.5 MJ) to remain normally active without losing weight.  Only
athletes or people with very extremely demanding jobs eat
significantly more than this.  Essentially all of this energy is
converted into heat inside our bodies — either by bacteria in our
intestines, by the various metabolic activities of our brain, liver,
muscles, and other tissues, or by damping work done on our bodies.
And there are no other significant thermal influxes under normal
circumstances.

These last two points deserve some elucidation.  The other day, I
walked up 12 flights of stairs because the power was out in the
elevator, about 50 meters.  I weigh about 110 kg, so this amounted to
about 54 kJ of mechanical work.  Roughly speaking, as I walked up the
stairs, my leg and butt muscles converted about 220 kJ of glucose and
other metabolic fuels to exhaust — carbon dioxide and water — and
converted about three-quarters of this directly into heat.  The other
one-quarter, however, was converted into the gravitational potential
energy of my body.

So, you could argue, if I kept walking up stairs all day long, only
about three-fourths of the calories I had consumed would be converted
to heat.  I could probably walk up about 900 flights of stairs in a
12-hour day of walking up stairs, at which point I would have done
about 4 MJ of mechanical work and gained about 4 MJ of potential
energy, and I would have expended about another 12 MJ of heat.  I
would be very hungry and my knees would hurt a lot.

I would also have reached an altitude of 3750 m above where I started,
a bit less than climbing Mauna Kea or Mount Ranier.  At some point, I
would probably have to come back down, which would convert my
gravitational potential energy back into mechanical energy, in my leg
and butt muscles.  Since my leg and butt muscles are not equipped to
convert mechanical energy back into glucose, they would convert it
back into heat.

(There are cases where the mechanical energy is eventually dissipated
in something that isn’t your body — when you go swimming or kayaking,
for example, or if you’re climbing a stair climber instead of actual
stairs.  Or if the power comes back on and you take the elevator
down instead of the stairs.  But these are unusual cases.)

I say there are no other significant thermal influxes under normal
circumstances because when you put people in an environment where they
cannot reject body heat to the environment, they die, usually in
minutes to hours.  So the net heat flux in a survivable situation is
always from your body into the environment.

“Literature” “review”
---------------------

[Porticool][2] is a brand name for a liquid-CO₂-cooled vest marketed
to HAZMAT specialists and other emergency responders, developed on a
DHS SBIR Phase I grant, using an open-loop system that releases 500psi
gaseous CO₂ from some of the tubes running through the vest, after
running it through non-porous tubes as a liquid.

> While other cooling solutions (ice vests, cooled air vests and
> liquid circulated garments) tested have shown favorable responses,
> none provide the flexibility and mobility afforded by the Porticool
> PCS. Nor could they compete with the light weight and thin garment

This doesn’t sound like something you could safely wear all day, if at
all ever, because you’d have to be replacing the liquid CO₂ and you’d
be constantly at risk of being poisoned by it.  (I guess I should
calculate how much CO₂ is emitted, but I think the answer is in the
range of a few kilograms or cubic meters per day, therefore liters per
minute.)

The DHS published [a superficial TechNote on personal cooling systems
in 2013.][3] It divides them into “passive systems” (like ice vests)
which contain no moving parts and “active systems” which do, for
example because they involve a circulating fluid, and therefore need a
power source.  (I suppose directly applying Peltier coolers would also
be “active” and without moving parts, but that wouldn’t be practical,
so probably nobody does it.)

It mentions evaporative cooling systems with “water absorption
crystals”; vests with phase-change material pockets, usually with
paraffin, which last up to 2 hours; “gel or ice pack vests”,
erroneously implied to not be phase-change materials; “ambient air
systems”, which blow ambient air under your clothes; and “liquid
circulating products” with vapor-compression or thermoelectric
cooling, or ice, to chill the liquid.  It shows a Veskimo
ice-backpack-powered cooling vest as its example of this last
category.  Apparently ASTM F2300 is the testing standard.

In 2014, [Adam Savage of Mythbusters and some other guys talked about
building a cooling suit][4].  The background is that, when he went to
ComiCon in a hot costume, he was trying a gel-vest system made of
“Polysorb...  like probably diaper crystals” and although “it’s a
brilliant design” he nearly passed out from heat exhaustion because he
didn’t have a freezer to freeze it in previously.  He said it should
have been able to keep him cool for an hour if he had frozen it.  He
also mentions a liquid-circulating cooling shirt called “CoolShirt”
which is sold for (auto?) racing, with “recirculating pumps that are
too big”; he didn’t think it was up to the job.

The video is a waste of time; it’s just three guys talking on
microphones for half an hour, and they haven’t even built the suit.

The [Veskimo cooling vest mentioned in the DHS report][5] runs
microtubing through a thin vest.  It explains:

> NASA pioneered the use of garments employing circulating chilled
> liquid in the 1960's to keep astronauts cool during space walks. The
> design and construction of these systems are well documented.
> Systems of similar construction are currently in use by military
> personnel in aircraft and armored land vehicles. These systems are
> very expensive because they use compressor-based refrigeration units
> to chill the circulating liquid coolant. By substituting ordinary
> ice to chill the water, the cost and complexity of the system is
> greatly reduced, making Veskimo Personal Cooling Systems affordable,
> yet still truly effective.
>
> ...The Veskimo Personal Microclimate Body Cooling Vest is made from
> lightweight breathable mesh fabric that will not inhibit the
> evaporation of perspiration, and has a thickness of less than
> one-quarter inch, so it fits easily under any close fitting garment
> or protective gear. Its zippered front and adjustable-length elastic
> side straps make it easy to take on and off and adjust for best fit,
> comfort and the desired degree of tube-to-skin contact.

Their page also mentions “evaporative garments” usually use sodium
polyacrylate crystals, like diapers, flowerpots, and maxi pads.
Because apparently the Veskimo people aren’t scientifically illiterate
like DHS employees, they class ice vests with other “phase-change
garments”.  They say their ice “backpack or cooler” is “typically
enough for 4 hours or more”.

[More details on the Veskimo system][6]:

They run their pump on 4 watts on a 12-volt Li-ion battery.  Their
[list price is US$1116 for the Veskimo vest and backpack][7], and on
top of that they’re out of stock, so a homemade substitute would be
worth considerable work.

Pants or shorts
---------------

A possible alternative to an ice vest would be ice pants, which would
be less of a weight burden (since only your legs would carry the
weight, not also your back) but perhaps more cumbersome.  Your legs
are similar in surface area to your torso and have very substantial
blood flow to them.

Peltier devices
---------------

A 100-W Peltier device is typically 10 A at 12 V and costs about US$15
retail, but [you need to run Peltier elements at substantially less
than their maximum rating to get reasonable efficiency][8]; at ΔT = 0
and I/Imax ≈ 0.3, Q/Qmax ≈ 0.5 and CoP ≈ 3.0 (that is, 3 joules of
heat are removed from the cold side of the reservoir for every joule
of electrical energy dissipated).  So maybe the 100-W device can give
you 50 W of heat rejection at 4 A (and, I suppose, very close to 12 V,
since thermocouples are closely approximated as constant-voltage
devices.)  As ΔT rises, the CoP falls, eventually past 0 as the
resistive heating effect of the current outweighs the Peltier effect.

In the case of a human in an environment that is only mildly
hostile — say, 30°–40° — ΔT ≈ 0, so this might be a reasonable region
to work in.  (XXX is it actually going to be adequate to keep your
skin at 30° or 35°, or is that going to result in dangerously low heat
transfer rates from the body core?  What skin temperature is adequate?
Presumably it’s about the same as the bearable air dewpoint.)  CoP ≈
3.0 means that you only need ≈30 W of battery power to reject 100 W of
heat to the environment, which means that each hour of cooling
consumes about 110 kJ of battery.  (The energy cost of pumps and fans
was 4 W in the Veskimo case, which is small compared to the Peltier
devices, though not insignificant.)

[An 18650 cell typically weighs 47 g][9] and costs about US$10, and is
commonly 2000 mAh and 3.7 V, for an energy capacity of 27 kJ, so you’d
be emptying on the order of 4 18650s per hour, weighing 190 g.  This
compares very favorably to the 1080 g of ice (100 W /
[(333 kJ/kg)][10] = 300 mg/s = 1081 g/hour) that you would need to
carry to absorb the same amount of heat by melting.  Ice is, of
course, substantially cheaper; equaling the four-hour 100-W capacity
of the 4-kg-of-ice Veskimo unit described above would require 16
18650s at a price of about US$160, plus another US$100 or more for the
Peltier modules and other materials.  But weighing only 750 g rather
than 4 kg could be a decisive advantage for the battery-driven unit
under normal weather conditions.

However, the humans require for comfort not just a low temperature,
but a low dewpoint; cooling the air next to the skin reduces the
temperature but not the dewpoint, at least until condensation begins.
[A dewpoint of 15–20° is required][11], which I think means that the
cooling vest or pants actually need to reach a *temperature* of
15–20°.  With an external temperature of 35°, that’s a ΔT as high as
20°, so according to [Meerstetter’s guide][8] we can’t expect a CoP of
better than about 1.2, and that at (again) I/Imax ≈ 0.30, at which
point Qh/Qmax ≈ 0.35 and Qh/Qc ≈ 1.75, so Qc/Qmax ≈ 0.20.  So we’d
need 5 “100W” Peltier elements to reject 100W of heat, and we need
83 W of battery power, emptying 11.1 18650s per hour, for a weight of
520 g of batteries emptied per hour.  This is still almost twice as
dense as the ice, but much pricier; your 4-hour unit now needs US$440
of batteries in it.  Also, you have the potential safety issue of
carrying 1.2 megajoules of highly volatile lithium batteries strapped
to your body.

Under extreme conditions like those described in the Wikipedia article
(as high as 65°) the ice-based system would continue to function
exactly as well, while the Peltier-based system’s efficiency would
degrade enormously, and it might cease to work entirely.
But perhaps under normal weather conditions the
Peltier approach might work better.

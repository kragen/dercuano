I'm frustrated with the slowness of web browsers at navigating
Wikipedia.
Navigating Wikipedia
is one of the most important tasks you can do on a computer;
it provides access to
a reasonable summary of
all human knowledge.

Ideally, there should be
*no perceptible delay*
between selecting a link
and seeing the resulting page.
The `links` browser can more or less realize this
for pages it has in its cache,
although only up to a certain size
and without displaying images.
More full-featured browsers,
unfortunately,
are not capable of such a feat.
To some extent this is a consequence
of the very powerful features of CSS and JavaScript
which do not admit general efficient implementations,
but in the case of Wikipedia,
the use of CSS and JS is quite stereotyped
and not at all essential to the main content.
It's entirely feasible
to provide no perceptible delay
for Wikipedia pages.

My current setup
----------------

I'm running `kiwix-serve`
on an English Wikipedia snapshot
and displaying it using links:

    ./kiwix/bin/kiwix-serve --port=8000 ~/Downloads/wikipedia_en_all_nopic_01_2012.zim &
    links http://localhost:8000/wikipedia_en_all_nopic_01_2012/

This snapshot,
which can be torrented,
occupies 9.7 gibibytes of disk space
and includes all the text and equations
but none of the pictures
from the English Wikipedia,
not even the most popular pictures
without copyright encumberment.
(I think that an additional gibibyte or two of images
could be extremely valuable.)
It's deeply unfortunate
that the version of `kiwix-serve` I'm using
is not fully functional without JS in the browser,
since the main reason for using `kiwix-serve` rather than `kiwix`
is to be able to browse using an unusual browser.

Back to the ideal:
"no perceptible delay"
could be operationalized as 200 milliseconds
(a traditional number from my memory of HCI research)
or 70 milliseconds
(the length of a typical keypress: 
you want to display the result page
before the user finishes pressing the key)
or 17 milliseconds
(the screen refresh time of nearly all current computer monitors).

70 milliseconds should be achievable
------------------------------------

Meeting any of these goals (17ms, 70ms, or 200ms)
would necessarily require a local replica,
if not a replica necessarily on my own machine;
`ping en.wikipedia.org` from my location in Argentina
reports 300ms average latency,
so even a single round trip would blow it.
In fact,
I haven't found anyplace in Argentina
with less than 250ms latency
to anyplace in the US.

I argue that a 70-millisecond response time is achievable,
with no network server,
using a reasonably powerful machine
(a netbook from a couple of years back,
or an Android phone with a large SD card).
The minimal amount of work involved
is displaying a screenful of data
(around 0.6 megapixels, or 1.8 megs uncompressed)
following a single random hard disk seek
(a 10ms cost which goes away if you're using an SD card)
after determining which
of perhaps a few dozen links on the screen
the user clicked on.
That is,
transferring three megabytes of data
from a random location on the disk
to the framebuffer.
This is almost the same task
that any movie player software
performs in 17 milliseconds,
except that it decompresses the frame from data in memory
instead of loading it from a random location on the disk.

A typical modern laptop hard disk
transfers some 20 megabytes per second,
or 20 kilobytes per millisecond.
That means that in the 70 - 10 - 17 = 43 remaining milliseconds,
it can transfer 860 kilobytes.
So we could meet our 70-millisecond performance goal
if we could compress the screen image to display
by only a factor of two.
However, we wouldn't be able to fit much of Wikipedia
onto a typical netbook hard disk
in that representation;
so compression is necessary for reasonable coverage,
as well as saving us much of those milliseconds
to use for other things!

A lot of work is needed.

According to Chromium,
`kiwix-serve` can serve up a typical page in
under 400ms on my netbook,
although it occasionally takes almost 500ms.
I don't know how much of that
is due to the LZMA2 compression used by the `.zim` file format,
and how much is due to `kiwix` being suboptimal.

Lossless image compression
--------------------------

I made a 1024×600 screenshot
of `links` displaying a screenful of a Wikipedia page
at 113×33 characters
(3729 characters).
This screenshot
compressed as PNG
takes 80 kilobytes,
or 72 kilobytes after `optipng`;
`pngtopnm`
decompressing it to raw data
takes 72 user milliseconds,
although given that the clock time is around 250ms,
I don't really trust that.
(The gzipped PNM decompresses in 20ms.)
A GIF version produced by ImageMagick is 63 kilobytes.
This is to say,
PNG or GIF compression
reduces it to such a size
that it needs about 3ms of disk transfer time
to load.

Here is the screenful, stripped of its highlighting
and hypertext links,
which should not comprise
a significant fraction of its size in bytes:

    Overview                                                                                                         

       Switzerland is a prosperous nation with a per capita gross domestic product higher than that of most          
       western European nations. In addition, the value of the Swiss franc (CHF) has been relatively stable          
       compared with that of other currencies.[3] In 2009, the financial sector comprised 11.6% of Switzerland's     
       GDP and employed approximately 195,000 people (136,000 of whom work in the banking sector); this represents   
       about 5.6% of the total Swiss workforce. Furthermore, Swiss banks employ an estimated 103,000 people          
       abroad.[4]                                                                                                    

       Swiss neutrality and national sovereignty, long recognized by foreign nations, have fostered a stable         
       environment in which the banking sector was able to develop and thrive. Switzerland has maintained            
       neutrality through both World Wars, is not a member of the European Union, and was not even a member of the   
       United Nations until 2002.[5][6]                                                                              

       Currently an estimated one-third of all funds held outside the country of origin (sometimes called            
       "offshore" funds) are kept in Switzerland. In 2001 Swiss banks managed US$ 2.6 trillion. The following year   
       they handled $400 billion USD less which has been attributed to both a bear market and stricter regulations   
       on Swiss banking.[7] By 2007 this figure has risen to roughly 6.7 trillion Swiss francs (US$6.4 trillion).    

       The Bank of International Settlements, an organization that facilitates cooperation among the world's         
       central banks, is headquartered in the city of Basel. Founded in 1930, the BIS chose to locate in             
       Switzerland because of the country's neutrality, which was important to an organization founded by            
       countries that had been on both sides of World War I.[8]                                                      

       Foreign banks operating in Switzerland manage 870 billion Swiss francs worth of assets (as of May 2006).[9]

This character data compresses to
1158 bytes with `gzip -9`, 3.22 times smaller,
1202 bytes with `bzip2 -9`,
and
1446 bytes with `compress`.

None of these programs take a significant amount of time to decompress the data,
but my measurement noise is around 4ms,
so they might be taking as much as 4ms.

Conclusion: compressed images are very heavy,
and to be avoided if possible.

Wikipedia size
--------------

As I mentioned, the English Wikipedia snapshot I'm using
is 9.7 gibibytes.
`kiwix-serve` reports that it contains
"1,766,695MB (3,874,564 articles, 262,623 medias)",
which is to say,
1.8 terabytes
in 3.9 million articles,
or 460 kilobytes
per article.
I seem to recall
that the text of a typical article
is some tens of kilobytes,
and almost none
are over 100 kilobytes,
so I assume that the bulk of that is the "medias".

Five random Wikipedia pages
(not in the snapshot)
are 4, 6, 7, 7, and 10 such screenfuls in links,
so I'm going to assume that 7 is a reasonable median
and 20 is a reasonable guess at mean
number of screenfuls.
That means we have about 80 million screenfuls of text,
or 300 gigabytes of text,
uncompressed;
perhaps it would be 93 gigabytes compressed.
This seems surprisingly large,
since the original Wikipedia source data
is only about 9 gigabytes
in bz2-compressed XML.
Nevertheless,
it's small enough to be feasible to store
textual snapshots
of this entire Wikipedia
on a normal netbook,
and you could retrieve any one of them with a single seek
if you identified them by number.

(If you printed out these 80 million 113×33 screenfuls
in a square,
they would be about
800 thousand characters wide
and 400 thousand tall;
in a normal ten-point font,
this would be about 500 feet square.)

Since lossless image compression
produced files that were some 40 times larger
than text compression,
we probably don't have room on the disk
for precomputed images of the entire Wikipedia,
pre-rendered.
However, it's probably perfectly adequate
to layout and render the text on the fly,
within limits.

Image selection
---------------

That doesn't help with things that aren't text,
and in particular, math articles suffer badly
from lack of diagrams.
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_function>
is rather hard to understand
without the graphs,
the first of which is an 8-kilobyte SVG
drawn with Adobe Illustrator
which gzips down to 988 bytes;
the third is a 9-kilobyte PNG.
If you included a single gigabyte of images,
you could include a million images
of the complexity of this SVG;
you could include one such image per article
in four gigabytes.

Presumably you want to optimize some kind of cost-benefit ratio,
perhaps using [page view counts][0] 
or lists of [featured articles][1] or [vital articles][2]
to estimate the benefit,
and the file size
(perhaps with an estimate of benefit due to compression)
to estimate the cost.
For example, [Georg Cantor][3] is a "vital article" 
that is read some [700 times a day][4],
and it uses a [diagram of bijection][5]
which is 1.8 kilobytes gzipped
and is also used on four other pages;
perhaps the [27-kilobyte portrait of young Cantor][6]
used on no other pages
does not contribute 15 times as much
to your replica of Wikipedia.
If a picture is one of the 3196 [featured pictures][7]
it's probably better quality.

[Wikimedia Commons says][8] it has 15 million files,
[which add up to][9] 22.5 terabytes.
This is substantially larger than any of the textual Wikipedias,
by about two thousand times.
The great bulk of this,
about 19.6 terabytes,
is JPEGs,
followed by
880 gigabytes of TIFFs,
600 gigabytes of PNGs,
520 gigabytes of Ogg video,
300 gigabytes of DjVu,
and so on.

These files range over a very wide range of sizes;
even consulting statistics by MIME type shows
that the 2597 MIDI files average 5.2 kilobytes
while WebM video files average 27 megabytes,
four orders of magnitude greater.
That is, all the MIDI files put together
are smaller than a single average WebM video,
and of course within each category, there are orders of magnitude of variation.

The [Commons metadata][10] is available for bulk download,
currently totaling about 2.4 gigabytes,
and could be used to measure the file size distribution more precisely.

Most of the JPEGs
are very large indeed,
and a much smaller version
would be more than adequate for initial page presentation;
some random images I selected 
using <http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:Random/File> 
were 
0.3 megapixels,
0.3 megapixels,
3.1 megapixels,
5.9 megapixels,
and a 22-kilobyte SVG.
Most of the time, however,
images are presented in the page
at a much smaller size.
For example, I clicked the "random" link above until I got a big image:
<http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ebensee1.jpg>, which
is 7.7 megapixels,
but where it's used on <http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezirk_Gmunden>,
it's scaled down to 150×99,
or 0.015 megapixels,
500 times smaller,
making it 7.5 kilobytes
instead of 4.9 megabytes.

(en.wikipedia.org has its own set of uploaded files,
totaling 800 thousand to Commons's 15 million.
I'm not clear if Commons images used on en
are included in that total.)

A quick sample of five random images
finds one used on the Hebrew Wikipedia
and none used in English Wikipedia.
Four more
finds one on nl.wikipedia;
eight more
finally finds [one image used on en.wikipedia as well as others][11],
one used on es.wikipedia,
one used on de.wikipedia,
and [one more used on en.wikipedia][12].
Naïvely, two out of 17 in the "sample"
should mean that on the order of 15% of the files in Commons
are used on en.wikipedia.
Both of these
are used at a reduced size in the articles,
and have an en.wikipedia File: namespace page.

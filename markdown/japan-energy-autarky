[Ian Welsh tweeted][0], “Japan HAS to import energy.”

Is he right?  It turns out that photovoltaic changes things; Japan can
sustain its current energy consumption on about 5% of its land area,
using plain cheap photovoltaic panels.  It will probably get the
majority of its energy from photovoltaic panels starting in the
mid-2020s, based on current growth rates.

[Wikipedia says Japan used 477.6 Mtoe][1] in 2011, which is
19.996 exajoules, a number suspiciously close to 20, or 630 GW
average.  The accompanying chart shows that the number is closer to
21 EJ, or 670 GW, roughly level since 1995.  [Solargis’s solar
resource chart][2] gives numbers of [global horizontal irradiance
(GHI)][4] from 1200 to 1600 kWh/m²/year; a rough average might be
1400, although [Wikipedia gives somewhat higher numbers of 4.3 to
4.8 kWh/(m·day)][5], which works out to 1600–1800 kWh/m²/year.
Solargis also offer a “potential PV electricity generation” map for
optimally-tilted free-standing crystalline silicon modules, ranging
from some 900 to some 1600 kWh/kWp, with most of the land around 1200.

[Japan’s area is 378000 km²][3], which gives us a total GHI of about
500 PWh/year, or 60 TW.  With 16%-efficient (polycrystalline Si)
horizontal solar cells, this gives us 10 TW, which is about 15 times
Japan’s total national marketed energy consumption.

That is, Japan could satisfy its current energy demands with about a
fifteenth of its total solar resource, occupying perhaps 5% or 10% of
its land area.  To supply these 670 GW with an unremarkable [solar
photovoltaic capacity factor of 20%][5] would require 3.3 TW of solar
panel nameplate capacity (TWp); currently installed at the end of 2016
is 42.75 GW, about 78 times smaller.  Installed PV capacity rose from
3.618 MW at the end of 2010 to 42.75 GW at the end of 2016, a factor
of 11.82, an exponential growth rate of 51% per year.  At this
exponential rate, Japan would need another 10.6 years (mid-2027) to
reach 100% of energy from domestic solar photovoltaic.  Presumably the
growth rate will slow earlier than that, perhaps around 2023.

At [current photovoltaic prices][6] of €0.53/Wp (May 2017, Japan/Korea
market), 3.3 TWp is 1.7 trillion euros.  Japan’s nominal GDP is
currently US$4.73 trillion per year, although only has US$697 billion
in exports (€608 billion at US$1.146/€).  So this represents an
investment of about 2.8 years of Japan’s exports or about 0.41 years
(5 months) of Japan’s GDP.  [Currently Japan pays a very high tariff
of ¥42/kWh for solar][1], which, at ¥114/US$, is US$0.37/kWh or
€0.32/kWh.  So the full €1.7T investment will be paid for by the next
5.3 trillion kWh (19 EJ) of solar energy consumed in Japan.

That’s only the cost of the panels, but at this point [the levelized
cost of new PV plants is under US$1 per peak watt][7], even including
the uncertainty premium to investors.  That is, the cost of the whole
plant is less than twice that of the panels.  We can expect that cost
to continue coming down.

There are some other obstacles to going majority-solar, such as
utility-scale energy storage for baseload power (photovoltaic panels
produce no significant power at night) and producing liquid fuels for
transport.  I expect them to be solved once the incentive of abundant
but intermittent and stationary solar energy is there, which will
probably require reducing the high solar tariff.

So, although Japan can definitely afford to switch to mostly
photovoltaic, it can’t do it much sooner than 2027, because it doesn’t
have enough exports.

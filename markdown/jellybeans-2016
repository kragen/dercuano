I thought I’d check out some of the cheapest and most popular items in
the most diverse IC categories on Digi-Key.

- microcontrollers: 61814 items
    - 72000 available of the US$2.86
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/MSP430G2755IDA38R/MSP430G2755IDA38R-ND/4090934>
      which is a TI MSP430, “16BIT 32KB FLASH 38TSSOP”.  16MHz, 32K
      flash, 4K RAM, probably the usual super low power, a 12-channel
      10-bit ADC, 32 GPIOs, internal oscillator, and so on.  Other
      MSP430 parts with 55601 available are #3.
    - 67594 available of the US$2.69
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/freescale-semiconductor-nxp/S9S08SG16E1CTLR/S9S08SG16E1CTLRDKR-ND/2252301>
      Freescale S9S08SG16E1CTLR, “8BIT 16KB FLASH 28TSSOP,” from their
      S08 series, which I’ve never heard of before.  It’s the
      MC9S08SG32 in the datasheet, in the HCS08 category, originally
      the 68HC08 or HC08, the successor to the 68HC05, a successor to
      the 6800.  Also it’s sometimes called the 9S08.  So despite all
      the obfuscation this is a 6800.  But a 40MHz 6800 with memory
      paging and on-chip flash, 16K of it I guess.  Von Neumann, 22
      GPIOs (with two selectable output drive strengths plus an
      optional pullup on input), 8 interrupt pins with selectable
      priority, a 16-channel 10-bit ADC, SPI, I²C, wakeup timer, PWM
      generation, 1024 bytes of RAM.  Its big brother, the ...SG32,
      has 32K of flash and operates up to 150°.  Runs on 5V, normally
      uses an external crystal, though it has a 40MHz internal clock
      source too.  It has a “standard 6-pin header” for a documented
      “background debug mode” that’s driven through a single-wire
      serial protocol, typically bitbanged from a PC.  The BDM
      documentation says there are other secret test modes too.  It
      makes it sound like chips of this family found in the field
      might have the Flash-reprogramming functionality available
      through the debug port disabled.
    - 45696 available of the US$3.20
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/atmel/ATMEGA48-20AU/ATMEGA48-20AU-ND/739775>
      Atmel ATMega48, “8BIT 4KB FLASH 32TQFP”.  20MHz, 8-bit, 23 GPIO,
      4K of flash and half a K of RAM, 8 10-bit ADCs.
    - 9000 available of the US$0.42
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/PIC10F200T-I-OT/PIC10F200T-I-OTTR-ND/665882>
      PIC10F200T-I/OT, a 4MHz Microchip PIC with 384 bytes (!!) of
      flash, 16 bytes (!!!) of RAM, and 3 GPIOs, in a six-pin SOT-23
      package, 3.1mm × 1.75 mm × 1.3 mm.
    - 4500 available of the US$1.01
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/atmel/ATTINY4-TSHR/ATTINY4-TSHRTR-ND/2238292>
      ATTINY4-TSHR, a 12MHz Atmel AVR ATtiny4 with 512 bytes of flash
      and 32 bytes of RAM, in the same package as the PIC.
    - 127 available of the US$1.11
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/silicon-labs/EFM8SB20F16G-A-QFN24/336-3175-5-ND/5115732>
      Silicon Labs EFM8SB20F16G-A-QFN24, a 25MHz 8051, “8BIT 16KB
      FLASH 24QFN”, with 4¼ kibibytes of RAM and 16 kibibytes of
      flash.  This is the cheapest microcontroller with over 4K of
      RAM.  It runs off 1.8 to 3.6 volts, with 16 GPIOs, a 15-channel
      10-bit 300ksps ADC, a thermometer good to about half a degree,
      and a PWM generator; of the “Sleepy Bee” line, “the world’s most
      energy friendly 8-bit microcontrollers”.  50 nA sleep current
      (or 300 nA with the internal RTC running), 170 μA / MHz; most
      instructions are 1- or 2-cycle, so if we assume an average of 1½
      and 1.8V, that's about 200 pJ/insn.  The RAM is “256 bytes
      standard 8051 RAM and 4096 bytes on-chip XRAM”; the GPIOs are 5
      mA source, 12.5 mA sink.  And it has an internal 20MHz ±10%
      clock, an internal 16 (or 32?) kHz clock, and a 24.5MHz ±2%
      one, so you don't need an external crystal, and the RTC
      optionally uses a watch crystal.  Four timers.  It ships with a
      UART bootloader.  Its “on-chip debugging interface” is a thing
      called “C2 Silicon Labs 2-Wire”, which is apparently public.
      4mm × 4mm.
    - 2,570 available of the US$3.49
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/atmel/AT80C51RD2-3CSUM/AT80C51RD2-3CSUM-ND/1026863>
      Atmel AT80C51RD2-3CSUM, which is a 5V 40MHz 8051 in a 40-pin DIP
      with no ROM; you hold its “external enable” pin low so that it
      executes code from an external ROM.
    - only 22 available of the US$2.06
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/intel/EE80C51FA24SF88/864420-ND/1464725>
      Intel EE80C51FA24SF88.  That’s an actual 8051!  With no ROM,
      using an external ROM.
- linear regulators: 58468 items
    - 163000 available of the US$0.71
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/LM317LIPK/296-21742-6-ND/1944499>
      LM317LIPK, an adjustable ungrounded linear voltage regulator
      that can output from 1.2 to 32 V at up to 100 mA, in a tiny
      SOT-89-3 case.  This LM317L family is the low-current version of
      the regular 1500mA LM317.  You adjust it with an external
      voltage divider providing negative feedback from its output; I
      guess you could probably use a FET in its linear region to make
      it a more custom voltage regulator.  And you can also use it as
      a precision current source!  Note that this part is more popular
      than any of the microcontrollers.  Its datasheet includes
      instructions for how to make a slow-turn-on regulator circuit
      with it, I guess to ensure that your brownout detection circuits
      have time to do a power-on reset.
    - 121799 available of the US$0.39
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/toshiba-semiconductor-and-storage/TCR2EF12,LM%28CT/TCR2EF12LM%28CTDKR-ND/4503462>
      Toshiba TCR2EF12,LM(CT), “LDO 1.2V 0.2A SMV”.  This is a
      1.2-volt output voltage regulator with an 0.38V dropout and up
      to 200mA of output.  I am guessing that this is such an
      important voltage because of NiMH battery chargers, but I don't know.
    - 14254 available of the US$0.12
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/MIC5365-3.0YC5-TR/576-3191-1-ND/1868228>
      Microchip (ex-Micrel) MIC5365-3.0YC5-TR, a tiny (1mm×1mm!) 3V
      150mA linear regulator.  I think this may be the cheapest linear
      regulator of all.
- memory: 40599 items
    - 168177 available of the US$0.23
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/M24C32-WMN6TP/497-5027-6-ND/1007946>
      STM M24C32-WMN6TP, a 400kHz 32-kibibit serial I²C EEPROM in an
      8-pin package.  STMicroelectronics will even sell you an unsawn
      wafer!  It supports random address reads, and also erases of
      individual 32-byte pages.
    - 130237 available of the US$0.36
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/winbond-electronics/W25X40CLSNIG/W25X40CLSNIG-ND/3008652>
      Winbond W25X40CLSNIG, a 104MHz (!) 4-mebibit (!!) dual SPI
      EEPROM in an 8-pin package.  It’s insane that this is literally
      256 times faster than and 128 times bigger than, but only 57%
      more expensive than, the #1 memory above.
    - 5357 available of the US$0.13
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/M24C02-FDW6TP/497-15746-1-ND/5283304>
      STMicroelectronics M24C02-FDW6TP, another 400kHz serial I²C
      EEPROM, this time 2 kibibits.  This one claims “More than
      200-year data retention,” which is a surprising claim I haven’t
      seen other Flash chips make, but now that I notice, the
      32-kibibit one above makes it too!
    - 27500 available of the US$2.78
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/M95M02-DRMN6TP/497-11405-2-ND/2679404>
      STMicroelectronics M95M02-DRMN6TP, another serial EEPROM with
      “200-year data retention”, but this time SPI, two megabits, and
      5 MHz!  It's in the same 8-SOIC as the others above.
- op-amps, etc.: 36285 items
    - 136806 available of the US$0.57
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/TSV321RILT/497-8164-6-ND/1884598>
      STMicroelectronics TSV321RILT “Op Amp GP 1.4MHz RRO SOT23-5”,
      “General purpose input/output rail-to-rail low-power operational
      amplifiers”, going 200mV past the power rails, good up to 125°,
      now replaced by the LMV321L.  These are lower-voltage versions
      of the LMV324 for the 2.5–6V range, have a 1.3MHz GBP, and can
      source or sink up to 80mA and is stable driving up to 500pF of
      capacitive load.
    - 99104 available of the US$1.00
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/LMC6032IMX-NOPB/LMC6032IMX-NOPBCT-ND/3440137>
      TI LMC6032IMX/NOPB, which is also a 1.4MHz GBP op-amp, but there
      are two op-amps on the chip, so it has 8 pins.  This one only
      sources or sinks up to 18mA, it’s not quite rail-to-rail, runs
      on 4.75–15.5V, and is stable driving up to 100pF of capacitive
      load.
    - 83402 available of the US$0.77
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/rohm-semiconductor/BU7411SG-TR/BU7411SGDKR-ND/2791706>
      Rohm BU7411SG-TR, an “Op Amp GP 4KHZ 5SSOP”, which makes it
      sound like it’s worse than the TSV321$ in every way, orders of
      magnitude worse in the GBP.  But it only need 0.35μA of supply
      current, and needs even lower voltages: 1.6–5.5V.  It can only
      source or sink a couple milliamps on its output.
    - 53751 available of the US$0.24
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/MCP6001T-I-OT/MCP6001T-I-OTCT-ND/697158>
      Microchip MCP6001T-I/OT, the world’s cheapest op amp.  This is a
      rail-to-rail 1MHz GBP op-amp using 100μA and sourcing/sinking up
      to 23mA, running on 1.8 to 6 V, in a SOT-23-5.  It says it’s
      “low power” but it consumes 300 times what the BU7411SG above
      does.
    - 2148 available of the US$0.31
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microchip-technology/MIC912YM5-TR/576-3691-1-ND/2339688>
      Microchip MIC912YM5-TR “Op Amp VFB 200MHz SOT23-5”, which is the
      cheapest 10MHz-or-over op amp; this was a Micrel part before
      Microchip bought them.  This uses 2.4mA of supply current, is
      stable with unlimited capacitive loads, and runs on 2.5–9V.  The
      datasheet PDF is corrupted, so I can’t find out more.
    - 51585 available of the US$2.77
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/analog-devices-inc/AD8606ACBZ-REEL7/AD8606ACBZ-REEL7DKR-ND/2468795>
      Analog Devices. AD8606ACBZ-REEL7 “Op Amp GP 10MHZ RRO 8WLCSP”.
      It’s a dual-op-amp chip, and the most popular (as measured by
      Digi-Key stock) RF op amp.  It’s immune to oscillation and phase
      reversal even when driving large (1000 pF) capacitive loads, and
      its picoamp input offset current allows you to use large
      feedback resistors.
- power management supervisor ICs: 35843 items
    - 67032 available of the US$0.54
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/on-semiconductor/NCP302LSN20T1G/NCP302LSN20T1GOSCT-ND/2121405>
      ON Semiconductor NCP302LSN20T1G two-volt detector in a 5-TSOP (a
      thin SOT-23 with five pins).  This is a power-on reset circuit.
      These suck 500 nA from 0.8 V to 10 V and produce an active-low
      reset signal when the voltage is below 2 V with hysteresis and a
      delay programmable with a capacitor on one of its pins.  “This
      device contains 28 active transistors.”
    - 56,660 available of the US$0.36
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/diodes-incorporated/APX809-31SAG-7/APX809-31SAGDICT-ND/1844722>
      Diodes Incorporated APX809-31SAG-7, which is basically the same
      thing, but with a 3.08V threshold voltage, a fixed delay of
      240ms instead of a programmable delay, and only 3 pins.  It
      sucks 30000 nA though and only works in the 1.1 to 5.5 volt
      range.
    - 38041 available of the US$0.64
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/torex-semiconductor-ltd/XC61CC2502MR-G/893-1027-6-ND/2138365>
      Torex XC61CC2502MR-G, which is a ±2% low voltage detector in a
      SOT-23 with a 2.5V threshold that sucks 700 nA.
- DC-DC switching regulators: 25051 items
    - 79,855 available of the US$1.16
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/TPS61221DCKR/296-41854-6-ND/5224781>
      TI TPS61221DCKR, a TPS61221DCKR, described as “Boost Switching
      Regulator IC Positive Fixed 3.3V 1 Output 200mA (Switch)
      6-TSSOP, SC-88, SOT-363”.  This takes an input of anywhere from
      0.7 to 5.5 volts and turns it into a 3.3-volt ±3% output at up
      to 200mA.  It needs an external inductor (4.7μH suggested,
      higher inductances give higher efficiency) and a couple of 10μF
      capacitors; the adjustable-voltage versions also use a couple of
      resistors for feedback.  At over 1V input and from 0.1 to 100 mA
      output, it’s over 80% efficient; above 2.3V input and 0.3 mA
      output, it’s over 90% efficient.  This is basically intended for
      running 3.3V circuits off rechargeable batteries.
    - 73,400 available of the US$0.70
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/alpha-omega-semiconductor-inc/AOZ1280CI/785-1277-1-ND/2769845>
      Alpha Omega AOZ1280CI, described as “Buck Switching Regulator IC
      Positive Adjustable 0.8V 1 Output 1.2A SOT-23-6”.  This is a
      step-down switching regulator that takes 3–26V in and produces a
      1.5MHz PWM output signal which you filter with a 2.2μH output
      inductor and a 10μF output bypass cap to get whatever voltage
      you want (programmed with a 800mV voltage divider), down to
      0.8V, at up to 1.2 amps.  It’s “up to 95% efficient”, but
      typically more like 80–90%.  It sucks a whole milliamp itself,
      though, so it's not suitable for super low-power circuits.
    - 58,254 available of the US$1.36
      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/vishay-siliconix/SIP12107DMP-T1-GE3/SIP12107DMP-T1-GE3CT-ND/3309123>
      Vishay Siliconix SIP12107DMP-T1-GE3 “Buck Switching Regulator IC
      Positive Adjustable 0.6V 1 Output 3A 16-SMD”, which honestly
      sounds like more of the same, but higher power and less
      versatile.  But it says it's “current-mode constant on-time”,
      and its switching frequency is 4MHz, and it has 16 pins.

      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/NE555P/296-1411-5-ND/277057>
      TI 555 (NE555P), the chip that gave birth to this product
      category in the 1970s.  The datasheet says, “September
      1973—revised September 2014”, which I guess means TI bought
      Signetics at some point.  Astable or monostable operation.
      Sinks or sources up to 200mA, runs on 4.5 to 16 volts, at 1
      millihertz to 100 kHz.  This is an 8-pin DIP.

      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/intersil/ICM7555IBAZ-T/ICM7555IBAZ-TDKR-ND/2529181>
      Intersil ICM7555IBAZ-T, which is a CMOS version of the 555, but
      runs at up to 1 MHz, with a wider 2–18 V power supply, and it
      runs on 60 μA and comes in an 8-SOIC rather than a DIP.

      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/texas-instruments/SN74LS628DR/296-37424-1-ND/4758875>
      TI SN74LS628DR, aka 74628, a 20MHz VCO, an improved version of
      the 74LS324, using an external timing resistor to improve
      temperature compensation.  Datasheet is from 1980, revised 1988.
      It can oscillate at roughly 2MHz to 20MHz as the
      frequency-control input voltage ranges from 1V to 5V.
    - the great majority of these 23000 items are very slightly
      different VCXOs whose prices start at US$30.

      8192 bits of 10ns RAM and 114 5V-tolerant GPIOs in an LQFP.
      Supposedly good up to 100MHz, with 50MHz multipliers.  Its cells
      have propagation delays of about 2 ns, are capable of
      implementing full-adders or even multiplier bits, and have
      diagonal interconnections to make multipliers out of.  Bitstream
      format and debugging features are apparently not documented.

      <http://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/microsemi-corporation/A3P030-QNG48/1100-1012-ND/2744959>
      Microsemi A3P030-QNG48, a ProASIC3/E FPGA with 34 3.6V-tolerant
      GPIO and “30000 gates”.  “Ideal for CPLD replacement.”  “1.5 V
      single voltage operation.” “350 MHz system performance.”  1024
      bits of flash that it can’t write to (and also its programming
      is stored in flash; it doesn’t have to load a bitstream to
      boot).  Consists of 768 "VersaTiles" which are three-input
      arbitrary functions registered with D flip-flops, but no RAM.
      No AES protection on its JTAG ISP.  Quiescent supply current is
      2 mA, enormous compared to the microcontrollers.  Maximum JTAG
      TCK clock is 19MHz.  Bitstream format and debugging features are
      apparently not documented.

      2.8 mm package.  This is not the highest-energy-capacity
      capacitor in the series (that would be the 25V 150μF type,
      holding 47 mJ, like the TAJV157M025#NJ in a 7.3 mm × 6.1 mm
      case, though Digi-Key doesn’t carry it; they'll sell you the
      lower-voltage 20V type TAJV157M020RNJ at US$2.17 but only in
      lots of 400) but it still has a pretty impressive energy
      density.  These are advertised as “standard tantalum”
      capacitors; I think that means they don’t have wet electrolyte.
      AVX's wet tantalum page explains, “AVX’s wet tantalum capacitors
      offer higher capacitance and voltage capability than solid
      tantalum capacitors.”  On another page, they say, “We are the
      global leader in MnO₂ solid tantalum technologies such as
      smallest case size MnO₂, highest temperature capabilities up to
      230°C and lowest DCL product offering,” and the TAJ series is
      indeed on that page.

      Kemet T491A106K010AT 10µF 10V 3.8Ω 3.2mm x 1.6mm tantalum
      capacitor.  This is also a MnO₂ capacitor.

      Kemet T491D107K016AT 100μF 16V 0.7Ω 7.3mm × 4.3mm tantalum
      capacitor.  This one is rated for 2000 hours, even though it’s I
      think also a MnO₂ capacitor.  This is really cheap for such a
      high-energy capacitor.

      Vishay 597D157X9025F2T, the cheapest 150 μF 25 V capacitor I
      could find.

      597D227X0025M2T, which is the 220μF version, with 37% more
      energy capacity per dollar.

Some interesting notes from the above list:

- High-speed serial interfaces usually are SPI rather than I²C.
- Although sub-picojoule-per-instruction CPUs exist in research labs,
  the ones you can actually buy are up in the hundreds-of-pJ range.

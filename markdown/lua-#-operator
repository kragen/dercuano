Improving Lua #L with incremental prefix sum in the ∧ monoid
============================================================

Lua’s #L operator, to find the length of a list, is implemented by a
binary search through indices to find an index j such that L[j+1] is
nil but L[j] is not.  This is not constant-time and produces erratic
results, but it allows the indexed assignment operation L[j] = nil to
be, I think, amortized constant time.

The solution
------------

A more predictable approach (or less euphemistically, an approach that
always gives the right answer) would add a binary tree onto the side
of tables and make L[j] = nil logarithmic-time like #L.  The idea is
simply that you maintain a set of user-invisible keys full(n, m) such
that

    L[full(n, m)] == true  ⇔  ∃i ∈ ℤ : i > 0 ∧ bⁱ = m ∧ m | n ∧ ∀j ∈ [n, n+m): L[j] != nil.

(We ignore the abomination of L[0] here.)

The base or branching factor b is a tradeoff between storage cost and
efficiency; 2, 3, 4, 8, or 16 might be reasonable choices.  The node
size m is a power bⁱ of b, and its start index n is a multiple of m.

Algorithms in more detail, with asymptotic costs
------------------------------------------------

When you set an index L[j] to nil, you need to look for
full(⌊j/bⁱ⌋, bⁱ) nodes that contained that index, deleting them and
increasing i until you don’t find one; at worst this takes
⌈log(|L|)/log(b)⌉ iterations, where |L| is the number of items stored
(at integer indices) in L; so, for example, deleting an item from a
list of up to 16 777 215 items and b = 4 might require up to 6
iterations.

Conversely, when you set an index L[j] that was previously nil to a
non-nil value, you may need to create up to a logarithmic number of
full(⌊j/bⁱ⌋, bⁱ) nodes; each node that is created requires verifying
the existence of b-1 existing child nodes that are siblings of the
node just created, treating indices L[k] as if they were full(k, 0)
nodes.  In our example, this potentially involves creating or
examining 4 nodes at each of 6 levels, a total of 24 iterations.

These are worst-case numbers; in most cases, deleting a numeric-index
table entry would not require the deletion of any full(n, m) nodes,
and adding one would not require the creation of any full(n, m) nodes,
and for typical usage patterns they would be amortized constant time,
just like the current implementation.  But it would be easy for a
program to provoke the worst-case logarithmic slowdown: create a large
list and repeatedly delete and recreate its first element.

Computing #L would follow a logarithmic-time process similar to the
present process, first walking up through the full(0, bⁱ) items until
it found the largest one, then walking back down looking for successor
nodes to last children.  In the worst case, this requires examining b
full(n, m) nodes at each of ⌈log(|L|)/log(b)⌉ levels; our example list
of 16 777 215 items would require examining 24 full(n, m) nodes, just
like insertion.  The difference from the current implementation is
that the answer it gives is precisely the index of the first non-nil
item whose successor is nil.

The storage overhead is up to |L|/(b-1) invisible table items that do
not exist in the current implementation.

This is precisely the parallel prefix-sum algorithm used for
incremental rather than parallel computation in the ∧ monoid.  Using
the ∨ monoid gives an alternative definition which could be computed
in a similarly efficient way, also complies with the current
definition, and is more similar to the definitions in sister languages
like JS and Perl, would return the index of the *last* non-nil item
(whose successor is therefore nil).  I think this is wrong for Lua,
because it’s unnecessarily incompatible with the behavior of `ipairs`.

Improving constant factors
--------------------------

As a locality and space optimization, it might be desirable to store
the full(n, m) items in a way that somehow tacks them on to L[n+m-1]
rather than as separate table items, sort of like a skip list.  For
example, you could store them in a bitmask indexed by log(m)/log(b).
(This allows the initial examination of the full(0, bⁱ) items in #L to
be done with a single instruction on some CPUs.)  Alternatively, you
could store them separately as ⌈log(|L|)/log(b)⌉ bitvectors of
logarithmically decreasing numbers of bits, but that seems like it
could be complicated if you start storing things at high indices.

As a complicated optimization, you could lump these bits into lumps
big enough to amortize storage overhead; taking again b = 4, in a
128-bit lump of level j, you could have 64 nodes of full(n, b⁵ʲ⁺¹),
16 nodes of full(n, b⁵ʲ⁺²), 8 nodes of full(n, b⁵ʲ⁺³), 4 nodes of
full(n, b⁵ʲ⁺⁴), and 1 node of full(n, b⁵ʲ⁺⁵), using 93 of the 128
bits.  You need one such level-0 lump for each run of 1024 list items,
a level-1 lump for each run of 1 048 576, a level-2 lump for each run
of 1 073 741 824, and so on; and you need zero such lumps until you
have a run of 4 items that’s properly aligned to generate a lump.
This limits the worst-case space overhead to 25%, if the lumps are the
same size as normal table entries.

In the case of b > 2, this storage optimization would also allow the
use of simple bit masking operations to simultaneously test for the
existence of all children.  But, for insertion and deletion, this
mostly helps with the worst case, because in the average case, you’re
overwhelmingly testing membership in the table itself.

The b tradeoff
--------------

Choosing b to be larger makes assertion of new values and computation
of length almost proportionally slower (O(N/log(N))), but also reduces
storage overhead by b-1 and makes deletion logarithmically faster
(O(1/log(N))).

Since deletion is much less common than insertion, it would be nice if
there was a way to shift that factor of N over to the deletion
algorithm.  I haven’t found one.  You might try the simple approach of
making nodes at a given level conditional on the existence of not just
all of their children but all of their previous siblings.  Thus
insertion creating a new node at a given level need only check for the
existence of its previous sibling to decide whether to create its
“parent”, but deletion potentially needs to delete all of its
following siblings.  But insertion at the beginning retains the same
worst case, and the usual case is amortized constant time, just as
before.  So I think this doesn’t really help.

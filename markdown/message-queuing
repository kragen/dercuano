I’ve been thinking about a new computational model to eliminate the
runtime costs of dynamic dispatch and take better advantage of modern
heterogeneous hardware.

Background
----------

### The Tera MTA ###

The Tera MTA was a computer that achieved consistently high
performance despite a high-latency main memory and no cache hierarchy
by hiding the latency with multithreading — its heavily-multibanked
RAM system could hold a lot of requests in flight, each one being
routed to an autonomous memory unit, and the CPU’s hardware context
switching with multiple hardware register sets meant that whenever
some data arrived from a memory unit, it would probably wake up a
thread that could do work on it.  In this way, the MTA was able to
achieve very high performance not only on cache-friendly tasks like
dense linear algebra but also on cache-unfriendly tasks like
traversing linked lists.

### The Actor model ###

The Actor model unifies objects, threads, and activation records into
a single “actor” abstraction, which reacts to an incoming message by
sending some set of other messages and changing its internal state.
Erlang is probably the language most directly based on this model, but
its evolution was intimately intertwined with that of Smalltalk, in
which an object that “receives” a “message” will “answer” it.

You could imagine an implementation of the Actor model in which each
actor is a physically separate piece of hardware, communicating with
other actors through some kind of bus or packet-switching network that
carries the messages; but it’s much more typical for a single CPU to
sockpuppet the actors one by one, first executing the code of one
actor, then the code of another.  Although the Actor model easily
accommodates an actor sending several messages without waiting for
responses, or receiving a message and not responding to it, the
traditional approach is for the CPU to implement nearly all message
sends by subroutine calls or returns.

### Dynamic dispatch is slow ###

One of the key difficulties in efficiently implementing Smalltalk and
similar object-oriented languages has been the overhead of dynamic
dispatch.  In theory, in Smalltalk, not just every function call, but
every arithmetic operation and every conditional, is performed by
sending a message to an object.  Conditionals are performed by sending
messages like #ifTrue:ifFalse: to a boolean object; arithmetic is
performed by sending messages like #+ to a number object.  The lack of
static type information in Smalltalk and descendant languages like JS,
Python, Objective-C, and Ruby means that in general the dispatch of
these messages requires some pointer indirections and a hash-table
search with the method selector.  This has led to performance in
optimized versions of these languages typically about an order of
magnitude worse than optimized C; Objective-C, like C++, avoids this
by reserving such dynamic method calls for special occasions.  (C++
additionally uses extra static type information to reduce the cost of
method lookup.)

There are two efficiency difficulties with this.  One is that the
dynamic dispatch itself requires a certain amount of computational
work — comparing a class identifier to the class identifier in an
inline cache, for example, or comparing method selectors found in a
hash table to the selector for the method being called.  The other is
that it necessarily involves a certain amount of pointer-chasing,
which implies random memory access patterns.  On a large memory, this
inevitably results in higher latency.  The single-threaded programming
model we use turns that high latency into low throughput.

### Actor message queues ###

Some versions of the Actor model, like the one implemented in Erlang,
associate a message queue with each actor — rather than running the
actor’s code immediately when a message is sent, the message is added
to a queue, and the actor’s code can run later to process the queue.
In Erlang, the process’s code can actually select particular messages
from the queue to process out of order, which is used to support a
call-response pattern in which a client sends a message to a server
process and then blocks until the reply is available.

Such queuing is a general-purpose system design pattern for
maintaining throughput in the face of large or highly variable
latency.

### Fast dynamic allocation with good locality ###

Generational copying garbage collectors typically require only about
two or three machine instructions to allocate memory in the nursery:
one to save the old value of a register, another to add an immediate
constant to it, and a third to compare its value against the end of
the nursery to see if the allocation succeeded.  In theory, if the
nursery is large enough, the work to iterate over the root set and
fish the few surviving objects out of the nursery will be amortized
over enough objects that the garbage collection work per object is
also very small.

This is still a great deal more work than is needed to allocate and
deallocate an object on the stack in C or C++, which is typically
zero, because the compiler can determine upon entry to the function
how much space its local variables will consume and subtract the total
from the stack pointer in a single operation.

However, maybe you can do the same thing for generational heap
allocation — check upon entry to a function to see whether the nursery
is big enough for everything you’re going to allocate, do a minor GC
if necessary, then preallocate all the objects you’re possibly going
to allocate in the function.  If the collector happens to run while
you’re still on the stack, it can relocate your entire “heap frame”
out of the nursery, consulting a liveness map to see which objects in
the heap frame have been initialized thus far in the function.

This should have the benefit that the objects you allocate in your
function remain close together in memory until after the function
returns.

### Mergesort converts random memory-access patterns to near-sequential ###

This is how people did compilers and databases in the days when they
only had a few kilobytes of RAM: they used multiple tape drives to
store data for the different passes of the compiler and to sort the
database into an order that allowed a single sequential pass over it
to produce the answers for all the queries (called “reports”, more or
less).

Consider the basic problem of a linker: after concatenating its input
files, it needs to combine a potentially large amount of object code
full of relocations with symbols providing definitions for those
relocations.  One way to do this is to take the list of relocations,
sort it in symbol order, and then merge it with the sorted list of
symbols to produce a list of instructions roughly of the form “add 382
to location 10078”.  Then, sort this list of instructions by location,
and then merge it with the object code.

If you have 100 megabytes of object code, 3 million relocations
(totaling 36 megabytes), 300,000 symbols (totaling 4 megabytes), 64
kilobytes of RAM, and eight “tapes”, then sorting the symbols requires
three passes totaling 24 megabytes of sequential I/O (one to break
them into 128-kilobyte sorted chunks, a second to merge those into
896-kilobyte sorted chunks, and a third to merge the five chunks);
sorting the relocations requires five passes, merging them with the
symbols requires one pass, and sorting them again requires five more
passes, for a total of 796 megabytes of sequential I/O; and then you
need a final pass to generate the linked object code.

Using actor queues to hide dynamic dispatch latency and increase locality
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

What if we use message queues instead of a call stack?

When you start running a function, it allocates a heap frame and
starts processing its incoming message queue.  While it’s running, it
can send many, many messages to other actors, but it can’t get
responses from them; it can allocate new objects in its heap frame
that will later handle responses, if need be.  It doesn’t need to
actually be able to access any information of those other actors; all
of its outgoing messages could even be accumulated in an
outgoing-queue buffer, which is perhaps part of that heap frame.

This requires that all of its loops be statically bounded from the
time you enter the function.  It’s okay if they iterate some
dynamically-determined number of times, but that number has to be
determined up front, because it affects how much to allocate.  This
means that the function is guaranteed to terminate.  This unforgivable
incursion upon Turing-completeness is not really a problem, since the
function can send messages to itself if need be.  In the worst case,
this reduces to continuation-passing style.

Once it exits, perhaps it is time to sort the outgoing messages by
destination.  Then we can select a next function to run, ideally one
with at least one message in its message queue.  Maybe we select the
function with the most messages in its message queue.

If the function’s input data and computational structure are
sufficiently regular, we can vectorize it, so that in fact it is
processing many input messages in a single instruction.  Perhaps
eventually those many input messages will result in response messages
going to many different destinations.

If the messages are like Smalltalk messages, consisting of a selector,
a “receiver” (in Smalltalk terms) on whose class the selector is
dispatched, and arguments, there are a few different ways the
dispatching could be amortized.  If the routing system can identify
the method, it can have a single queue for that method, with messages
for many different receivers mixed in it.

Note that in this model, unlike in Erlang, we can guarantee in-order
message delivery between a given pair of actors, even though
there’s a great deal of nondeterminism about sequencing otherwise.
But taking advantage of that requires state to exist in the actor,
unlike the actor-per-method approach suggested in the previous
paragraph, where the actor is a stateless method.  (And it seems like
with this amount of nondeterminism in ordering, you really want to
keep local state to a minimum; maybe only a kind of
barrier-synchronization primitive, which aggregates two or more
expected messages from different sources, should be allowed to have
any mutable state.)

Alternatively, you could have queues per selector, per object, or per
class.  The function handling the per-selector queue would forward the
message, somehow, to the appropriate method; the per-object or
per-class function could perhaps contain the code for all the methods.

This approach, despite its obvious drawbacks in nondeterministic
ordering of operations and potential to be slower rather than faster,
has some potential advantages:

1. You can, obviously, replicate and distribute the actors across a
   network for (ha) performance.

2. You can take advantage of heterogeneous hardware by running
   different actors on different hardware — some might run much
   faster, for example, on a GPU or an FPGA.

3. You can distribute actors across *time* rather than *space* in
   cases where memory is limited — you need only have one actor in RAM
   at a time, as each message contains everything that is needed to
   process it.  This could allow you to run large late-bound systems
   on very minimal hardware.  (This is really just another way of
   looking at the benefits of running in the CPU cache on a modern big
   CPU.)

4. Even very large setup and teardown costs could potentially be
   amortized over a large number of messages.  For example,
   reprogramming an FPGA with a bitstream that implements a particular
   actor might take milliseconds — maybe seconds if you have to run
   project IceStorm to generate the bitstream — but if it’s processing
   a million queued messages, that’s likely okay.

5. The ordering nondeterminism I moaned about over and over again
   amounts to separating the scheduling concerns about latency
   vs. throughput vs. memory usage from the algorithmic concerns about
   what to compute.  Perhaps being able to change your scheduling policy
   separately from the code will empower you to choose a better one.

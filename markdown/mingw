So MinGW originally was part of the GNU-Win32 project, aka Cygwin.
Cygwin provides a Unix environment inside of Microsoft Windows, on top
of Win32; I used to use it a lot when I used Windows NT at work.
Cygwin includes a full GCC compiler suite and everything, but the
executables it produces depend on the Cygwin DLL to provide the POSIX
API.

MinGW, the "Minimalist GNU-Win32", instead let you use GCC to build
applications that are written to use the Win32 API instead of the
POSIX API.

This was all very well, but not of much use to those of us who used
free operating systems like Linux and therefore didn't have an
implementation of the Win32 API at hand.

But gradually, over the years, WINE got better and better, and now it
implements the great majority of the Win32 API (although not enough to
run the great majority of Win32 programs).  And Linux's flexible
binary format support makes it relatively transparent.

So now, on my Debian Stable system (that is, "etch", which is mostly
from 2006), I can do this:

    kragen@thrifty:~/notes$ cd ~/devel
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ cat > hello.c
    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(int argc, char **argv) {
        printf("hello, %s\n", argc > 1 ? argv[1] : "world");
        return 0;
    }
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ i586-mingw32msvc-gcc hello.c -o hello.exe
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ ./hello.exe 
    Invoking /usr/lib/wine/wine.bin ./hello.exe ...
    hello, world
    Wine exited with a successful status
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ ./hello.exe Win32
    Invoking /usr/lib/wine/wine.bin ./hello.exe Win32 ...
    hello, Win32
    Wine exited with a successful status
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ 

(I have both mingw32 and wine installed.)

Some GDI Hello Worlds
---------------------

I googled up some Win32 tutorials, got some code that almost ran, and
hammered it into shape and got this, which I can compile and run:

    // Win32 GDI hello world program, slightly modified to compile in C
    // (C9x), without MSVC, not be formatted like total ass, and add some
    // obscenities, by Kragen Javier Sitaker

    // But the original is written by RoD@cprogramming.com, to whom I am
    // greatly indebted for sharing his knowledge of Win32 (despite my
    // complaints about the formatting); it is available at
    // <http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/opengl_first_windows_app.html>

    // I compile and run it on my Linux box with MinGW and WINE as follows:
    // kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ i586-mingw32msvc-gcc -Wall hi.c -lgdi32 -o hi.exe
    // kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ ./hi.exe

    #include <windows.h>

    // event handler
    LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd,
                             UINT message,
                             WPARAM wParam,
                             LPARAM lParam)
    {

      }

      return DefWindowProc(hWnd, message, wParam, lParam);
    }

                         int nCmdShow)
    {

      if (!RegisterClassEx(&windowClass)) return 0;

      // What shithead thought it was a good idea to write a function with

      hWnd = CreateWindowEx(0,                    // extended style
                            "MyClass",            // class name
                            "A Real Win App",     // app name

                            NULL);                // no extra parameters
      // XXX probably should use ShowWindow, not WS_VISIBLE

      if (!hWnd) return 0;

      // main message loop
      for (;;) {
        // XXX probably should call GetMessage, not PeekMessage
        // XXX and look for <= 0 return value to exit loop
        PeekMessage(&msg, hWnd, 0, 0, PM_REMOVE);
        if (msg.message == WM_QUIT) return msg.wParam;
        // Translate and dispatch to event queue
        TranslateMessage(&msg); 
        DispatchMessage(&msg);
      }
    }

That builds and runs.  A little later I found this much smaller Win32
"hello, world" in what looks like a much more competent tutorial:

    // http://www.winprog.org/tutorial/start.html

    #include <windows.h>

    int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, 
        LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
    {
        MessageBox(NULL, "Goodbye, cruel world!", "Note", MB_OK);
        return 0;
    }

That builds and runs too.

For some reason, `winedump` reports that they belong to "subsystem 0x3
(Windows CUI)" rather than "subsystem 0x2 (Windows GUI)".  I found
that I could fix this by using the `-Wl,--subsystem,0x2` option on the
GCC command line.  This also keeps Windows XP from opening a console
window for it.

Upsides
-------

Most obviously, you can write, test, debug, and compile programs for
Win32 so that you can run them on Win32-only machines.

Also, you get fantastic stack dumps when you crash.  Here I've deliberately
introduced a null pointer write to demonstrate:

    wine: Unhandled page fault on write access to 0x00000000 at address 0x4012df (thread 0009), starting debugger...

Downsides
---------

There are also some downsides.

For example, I have a little SDL display hack, and since SDL runs on
Win32, in theory I ought to be able to compile it for Win32 with MinGW
and run it in WINE.  But I don't have a Win32 version of SDL, any idea
of how to compile one, or any idea of where to install it so that
MinGW can find it; these problems would be easier if I were actually
using Visual Studio on Microsoft Windows XP or something, since lots
of other people would have solved them already.  They're really,
really easy for the platforms Debian focuses on:

    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ apt-file search SDL.h
    gambas-doc: usr/share/gambas/help/ArticleSDL.html
    iceape-dev: usr/include/iceape/websrvcs/nsIWSDL.h
    icedove-dev: usr/include/icedove/websrvcs/nsIWSDL.h
    libsdl1.2-dev: usr/include/SDL/SDL.h
    libxul-dev: usr/include/xulrunner/websrvcs/nsIWSDL.h
    pike7.6-reference: usr/share/doc/pike7.6-doc/html/reference/ex/predef_3A_3A/SDL.html
    plib1.8.4-dev: usr/include/plib/puSDL.h
    plib1.8.4-pic: usr/include/plib/puSDL.h
    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev

And after doing that, you can compile your SDL program.

And, of course, most of the conveniences we glibc users have grown
accustomed to just aren't there in Win32; it's really an environment
designed for C++, not C.

The first "hello, world" above produces an executable of over 200kB,
or almost 600kB with `-g`, but that's mostly debugging symbols;
`strip` reduces that to just over 7kB, and `-Os` plus `strip`.

And, although GDB knows how to read `hello.exe`, it doesn't really
know how to debug it:

    kragen@thrifty:~/devel$ gdb hello.exe
    GNU gdb 6.4.90-debian

    Error accessing memory address 0x280: Input/output error.

    (gdb) q
    The program is running.  Exit anyway? (y or n) y

(In theory there's also `winedbg --gdb` which works OK when I `winedbg
--gdb winemine.exe` but not when I try to run it on my `hello.exe`.)

Finally, although Win32 has some good points, mostly it is a tacky
piece of crap, and not that much fun to program against.  It's roughly
as bad as Xlib.

Other Win32 Tutorials
---------------------

theForger's/Brook Miles's/forgey's win32 tutorial is fantastic:
<http://www.winprog.org/tutorial/start.html>

Another copy of it:
<http://www.vczx.com/tutorial/win32-tutorial/message_loop.html>

RoD's fairly incompetent and sloppy tutorial, which additionally is
full of patronizing content-free text:
<http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/opengl_first_windows_app.html>

Another one, on "Application Creation", verbose and full of errors (I
count nine errors in the 12 paragraphs before the second heading, and
it seems to continue at almost one error per paragraph thereafter; my
god, it's comedically awful --- you might actually know less about
Win32 after reading this than before):
<http://www.functionx.com/win32/Lesson01b.htm>

This one isn't too terrible, but it still contains a few errors and
some voodoo code; I haven't finished it:

-----------

So, although we've come a long way, Debian isn't yet really the

barely possible to do so.  I think we're actually a lot further along
for .NET stuff than for Win32 stuff.

Microsoft Windows uses \ for filenames because OS/8 programs used / for switches
================================================================================

A response to [Michal Necasek’s “Why Does Windows Really Use Backslash
as Path
Separator?”](http://www.os2museum.com/wp/why-does-windows-really-use-backslash-as-path-separator/),

This is almost correct, but MS-DOS derives from the DEC small systems
line (the PDP-8 and PDP-11), not the large systems line that ran
TENEX, which took the name "TOPS-10" in the DEC Witness Protection
Program (the PDP-6 and PDP-10).  TENEX's only real descendant in
modern computing systems is the command-line editing (and filename
completion?) in bash and zsh.

Much to my surprise, it seems to be true that CP/M did not actually
use / for flags, even in PIP, although other incarnations of PIP (like
that in Heath's HDOS) did use /.  The CP/M 2.2 manual is at
<http://www.cpm.z80.de/manuals/cpm22-m.pdf> and documents the command
lines of all the standard utilities, including the assembler, PIP, and
the text editor.  (It also, in passing, documents the full 8080
instruction set and OS API.)

TENEX was born in 1969 but grew up in the 1970s, but the use of / for
switches in DEC-land predates it;
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concise_Command_Language> is somewhat
confused, but it currently describes how the PDP-6 monitor program
used / for switches in, presumably, 1964.

DEC operating systems like the ones CP/M aped used / liberally for
switches, and third-party programs we used on CP/M certainly did use /
for switches.  This was not limited to the PDP-10 large systems
operating systems; it was also true on OS/8 for the PDP-8, as
described in <https://www.pdp8.net/os/os8/index.shtml> (though, as you
can see, some commands used - instead, like the later Unix).  The
PDP-8 shipped in 1965, but OS/8 might be more recent than that.

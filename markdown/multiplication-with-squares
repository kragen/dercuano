This is a table-lookup-based multiplication algorithm I wrote about
some years ago which is not in much current use, even though it’s much
less computationally expensive than the standard algorithms.

> (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b²  
> (a - b)² = a² - 2ab + b²  
> (a + b)² - (a - b)² = 4ab  
> ab = ((a + b)² - (a - b)²)/4

    def mul(a, b):
        c, d = a + b, a - b
        csq, dsq = c**2, d**2   # Imagine these are table lookups.
        e = csq - dsq
        prod = e/4
        print 'c=%s, d=%s, c²=%s, d²=%s, c²-d²=%s, so %s·%s = %s' % (c, d, csq, dsq, e, a, b, prod)

For example, to multiply 7984839 by 11859552, first find their sum and
(unsigned) difference: 19844391 and 3874713.  Find the square of each:
393799854160881 and 15013400832369.  Now find the difference of these
squares: 378786453328512.  Now divide this by 4 (an easy operation on
a binary computer; somewhat trickier in decimal): 94696613332128.  And
that is indeed the product of these numbers.

If you have a table of squares to do lookups in, this involves a sum,
two differences, two table lookups, and a division by 4 (a shift right
by two bits, in binary).  These all involve a number of bit operations
that grows linearly with the number of bits in the input numbers, but
require a square table whose size is exponential in the size of the
input numbers.

(This algorithm was known to the ancient Babylonians, who tabulated
squares divided by 4 to facilitate it; flooring the squares is
harmless in this case.)

One disadvantage of this algorithm is that, to multiply numbers up to
N, your table of squares must include numbers up to 2N.  If the
numbers you are multiplying are both even or both odd, a slightly
different identity allows you to use a table of squares of only N
numbers:

> ((a + b)/2)² = ¼(a² + 2ab + b²)  
> ((a + b)/2)² - ¼a² - ¼b² = ½ab  
> 2((a + b)/2)² - ½a² - ½b² = ab

This requires three table lookups instead of two, and the same three
additions and subtractions, plus a couple of halvings and a doubling
rather than two halvings.  If the table contains the halves of the
squares, you save the halvings but need a final multiplication by 4.

So, consider 61·65.  (a+b)/2 = 63, and 63² = 3969; twice that is 7938.
½61² = 1860½, and ½65² = 2112½.  So our final result is 7938 - 1860½ -
2112½ = 3965, and this is correct.  This didn’t require us to find the
squares of any numbers bigger than our multiplicands.  However,
rounding the numbers in the table of half-squares would be unsafe for
this algorithm.

All known bounded-space multiplication algorithms take a number of bit
operations that grows superlinearly in the number of bits in the input
numbers: multiplying by partial products takes O(n²) operations (which
was conjectured to be optimal from 1952 until 1960), Karatsuba
multiplication (see file `karatsuba`)
takes O(n¹·⁵⁹) operations, Toom-Cook multiplication
takes O(n¹·⁴⁷) operations, Schönhage-Strassen multiplication takes
O(n log n log log n) operations, and Fürer’s algorithm and the
De-Saha-Kurur-Saptharishi multiplication algorithm take time that is
still superlinear, but only barely.

However, for numbers of under about 100 decimal digits, multiplying by
partial products is the fastest of the above-listed algorithms in
practice.  But this square-table algorithm is faster than multiplying
by partial products even for numbers of moderate size.

For example, the above calculation involved calculating 44 decimal
digits of results; doing the calculation by summing seven eight-digit
partial sums into the 14-digit result would have involved calculating
60 decimal digits of results.  So this is an efficiency improvement.
However, it presupposes a table of over eleven million squares, which
would be several volumes if printed on paper.

The crossover point where this algorithm uses fewer bit operations is
probably around 16 bits.  The square table becomes impractical in size
somewhere between 8 bits and 50 bits, depending in part on how long
you can wait to get the results.  If you’re multiplying a lot of pairs
of numbers, it might actually make sense to pipeline a millisecond’s
worth of products while you’re waiting for the square table lookup
results to come back from a highly parallel, distributed square table.

Something occurred to me on the way back.  I was thinking about the
lack of good notation for state machines, as opposed to pure
functions; we don’t have anything equivalent to Haskell for state
machines, unless you count Haskell itself.  But when you’re using the
state monad in Haskell to write state machines, lots of stuff goes
away: you can no longer reasonably write it in point-free style, for
example.  I think.

The closest we have is Forth, which lets you write state machines in
point-free style, but only up to a certain point: once you have more
than two or three live values, you start to get confused about stack
depth and stuff.

It reminded me of a thing I saw someone (Jeff Fox?) say a few years
back about how stacks and registers are sort of duals at the level of
CPU design: a stack lets you retrieve each value only once, but store
many values, while a register lets you retrieve each value many times,
but store only one value at a time.  And it occurred to me that a way
out of this is to make variables in Forth work a different way: rather
than simply pushing a memory address onto the stack, instead each
variable could name a separate stack out of a potentially infinite
variety of stacks, and uttering its name could switch future
evaluation onto that stack (until future notice).  You’d need @ and !
to store and fetch values from some special magic place that wasn’t on
a stack: a register.  But you could still say N @ M ! to move a value
from N to M.

A couple of things that occurred to me about this notion:

- /=, +=, *=, etc., are the fundamental operations in a sense.  N 3 +
  is sort of the equivalent of n += 3; from C.
- You get named local variables for free (naïvely, with shallow
  binding) as long as you’re careful to store into them before you
  fetch.
- The return stack stops being special; it’s just another variable.
- PICK replaces array indexing, as long as you don’t mind indexing
  from the end of your array.  That is, all of your variables are, in
  a way, aggregates (APL-style), although this competes with them
  being automatically local.

It occurred to me that this could maybe give you a notation for
writing state machines with variables that was similar to RPN for pure
math or regexps for state machines without variables.

[Some text in this note is from me typing messages to someone who
could see my screen, and who I could hear, but who could not hear me.
That’s why it sounds like half of a conversation; it is.  I may come
back and edit this out at some point.]

Maybe interesting?

How about the “largest prime factor”?  That’s sort of cheating, maybe,
since I was thinking about it...

So let’s see.  You have a sequence of letters, which we could push
onto a stack as the argument; call it INPUT; then we want to switch
between consuming whitespace and non-whitespace, incrementing a
counter each time?

I guess arguments should be like a default named stack?  Call it <>.
What’s not needed?

What does that look like if you want to, say, increment n?

OK, so some of the things on the argument stack should be arguments to
the function and others should be other stacks?

You mean, put the state variable on the same stack as the input?

Do you want to type that out?  Because I don’t understand still.

So you use @ and ! to pop and push from the other stacks?  Then you
have something almost exactly like Forth with shallow-bound local
variables and the need to dup values on the stack instead of in
variables, which could be interesting; let’s see if that’s fruitful in
a bit.

Hmm, { } from StoneKnifeForth is probably the wrong way to go, because
most loops are better as while loops rather than do-while loops.  So I
think Knuth's/Forth's BEGIN/WHILE/REPEAT is better; but I want to
spell it { | }.

    : wc-w 
      n 0                           \ initialize counter to 0
      { <> empty? ~ |
        <> { dup isblank? | pop }      \ drop characters until we find a blank
        n 1+                           \ here we switch to the n stack
        <> { dup isblank? ~ | pop }    \ again, but until we find a nonblank
      }
      n @ <> ! ;                       \ return n

    : isblank? dup bl = [ pop #t exit ]     \ [ ] are IF THEN, with no ELSE.
               dup \n = [ pop #t exit ]
               dup \t = [ pop #t exit ]
               pop #f ;

<> switches to the <> stack.  dup dups on the current stack, whatever
it is, and immediately after executing <> it is the argument stack.

It does seem kind of promising, no?  Somewhere I guess we have to
declare n.  Oh, and it’s buggy because it always underflows the stack
in the inner loops.

Reformatted horizontally:

    : wc-w  n 0  { <> empty? ~ | <> { dup isblank? | pop }  n 1+ 
                                 <> { dup isblank? ~ | pop } }
      n @ <> ! ;

Suppose my text is in memory instead of on the stack?  It seems like
we need a lot of dups in this notation, so I'm going to use “,” for
dup.  This is looking suddenly a lot harder... how do I transliterate
`while (n && isblank(*t)) t++, n--;`?

`n , [ ... ]`, so far so good; if we press into service | for “else”
as well as “while”, then we can end up with `n , [ ... | 0 ]`.  But
then what are you doing inside?  You want to 

That seems very promising!  It could even be a deterministic regexp,
perhaps, so that you don’t have to handle backtracking.

Backtracking is tricky in the presence of add1.

Python itertools and family (not to mention Unix shell) show that you
can do quite a lot by plugging together state machines that generate
and consume sequences.

    : wc-w  @ t !  <> @ n !  words 0
      { n , | { n , [ t , c@ isblank? | t ++  n -- }

Should exiting from a loop or conditional restore you to whatever
stack you were working on when you entered it?

What does this look like in Real Forth?  Is it simpler?

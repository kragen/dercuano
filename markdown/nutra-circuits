Notes on circuitry for the Nutra seed activator
===============================================

The Nutra has a fan (I’m guessing something like a 12V PC cooler), a
¼HP agitator motor, a small pump motor, a water inlet valve, and a
heating element.

Lucía tells me the target is for a year’s lifetime.

I’m thinking that probably the control solution for these is to hook
up an STM32 to a ULN2003 or something similar, then use the ULN2003 to
run some relays.  None of them needs subsecond response times; I think
they are each turned on and off less than ten times during a cycle,
which lasts roughly a day, so a lifetime of 20000 openings/closings
and an MTBF of 100 000 openings/closings is probably adequate.  Most
of them will run on line power rather than a lower voltage, so the
ULN2003 can’t handle them directly.

Heating element
---------------

I back-of-the-envelope estimated the heating element at 300 W, but
maybe 600 W is a safer level (in the sense of “we are sure it will
work”, not in the sense of “less likely to cause injury in case of
malfunction”.)  600 W is about 2.6 amps at 240 VAC (RMS), so a 3-amp
relay is probably fine.

But wait, this needs to be PWM-controlled.  PWM through a relay is not
a good idea; if the PWM cycle is 20 seconds in length (50 mHz),
100 000 openings and closings only gets us to 555 hours of dehydration
time.  An SSR would achieve higher levels of reliability, but 500
hours is probably already a year, since the overall cycle might have
an hour or two of dehydration in it.

### Power ###

The most challenging objective is dehydrating 5 kg dry weight of
soaked, activated beans to more or less their original dry weight.
They will have absorbed roughly 5 kg of water.  [Water’s enthalpy of
vaporization is about 2.4 MJ/kg][e], so this is 12 MJ which get turned
into latent heat.  Doing this in one hour would require 3000 watts,
which would be 12 amps.  At my previous guess of 600 watts it would
take five hours, which might be long enough for the beans to rot.

If we could use an air-countercurrent recuperative condenser like the
ones in modern condensing clothes dryers, we could perhaps reduce that
somewhat, but I’m not sure how much.  (There are also heat-pump
dryers, basically air-conditioner-based dehydrators in a box, which
cost an extra US$1200 or so.)  [Traditional vented clothes dryers use
4–6 kW and vent 100–225 cfm][7], [or more broadly 3–9 kW, while
non-heat-pump condenser dryers typically use 2 kW, and heat-pump
condensers use ≈ 1 kW][8].

Let’s say we don’t have a recuperator, but 2 hours is adequate, so we
can get by with 1500 watts.  And let’s say the air stream is limited
to 40° in order to make sure we don’t heat the food past 42°.  My
psychrometric chart doesn’t go to 100% humidity at 40°, but it says
that 30 mg H₂O / g air is 64% humidity at 40°, so I guess 100% is
about 47 mg H₂O / g air, and 95% would be about 44 mg H₂O / g air.
This means that removing 5 kg of water vapor would require passing
about 114 kg of dry air through the beans, or a bit more, since the
air in Buenos Aires already contains something like 10 mg H₂O / g air.

[Air is about 1.23 kg/m³][5], so 114 kg of air is 92 m³.  This is
enough air to fill a 35 m² room of 2.6 meters height, and we’re
proposing to turn it all into the kind of fog that fills your bathroom
after a shower.  So you really, really need to vent it outside or
run it through a condenser.

Either way, those 92 m³ of air need to be blown through the dehydrator
during those 2 hours, which works out to about 12.8 ℓ/s, 770 ℓ/minute,
or 27 cfm.  This is the kind of airflow associated with bathroom fans
with 8 cm ducts, or with small or quiet fans for computer
cases — definitely feasible.

You don’t want to blow *too much* new air in because you have to heat
it all up — [air’s heat capacity is 1.01 kJ/kg/K][6], so each
additional ℓ/s is 1.23 g/s and 1.24 W/K, and with ΔT ≈ 20 K that works
out to about 24 W of extra heater power, plus whatever the fan uses.
This isn’t very much extra energy use but it’s energy use that doesn’t
evaporate much extra water.

(Or is it?)

Here in Buenos Aires, we have abundant municipal water which we could
use to chill a condenser, and the Nutra already needs access to both a
water intake and a drain.  How much water would it waste?  If we drop
the dewpoint of the air to 25° (thus removing more than half the
water) by running it through a countercurrent heat exchanger cooled by
tap water starting at 15°, well, we would need 290 ℓ of water to dump
those 12 MJ of heat.  This might be okay in some kind of objective
sense but people who run dietéticas are not going to tolerate it.

Lucía previously calculated that she would need a 2000-watt heater.

Water inlet valve
-----------------

I have no idea what the water inlet valve is like.  I’m guessing it’s
a solenoid driven by line power (through a diode) at under an amp.

Small pump motor
----------------

The pump needs to drain 6 liters (I think) of water within, I don’t
know, 20 minutes.  5 mℓ/s, 0.08 gallons per minute, 5 gallons per
hour.  This is a very small pump; a [US$11 aquarium pump on Amazon][0]
is 227 GPH, 45 times as big, and it’s 18 watts.  So I think this is
more like a 1-watt pump.  The intrinsic work being done is very small,
possibly even negative, but pumping 5 milliliters per second against a
pressure of 1 meter column of water would be 50 milliwatts, plus
whatever mechanical inefficiencies are encountered.

It might be feasible to run this directly off the ULN2003.

¼HP agitator motor
------------------

This is 190 watts output, perhaps 220 watts input — 1 amp at 240
volts.

Fan
---

A typical PC fan is like 100 to 300 milliamps at 12 volts.  This could
possibly be run directly off the ULN2003, which can handle 500 mA on a
given pin at up to 50 V, though only one pin at a time.

Relays
------

So we probably need a couple of 1-amp relays, a 3-amp relay, and maybe
another sub-1-amp relay for the pump.  If we simplify this to four
3-amp relays, well, the usual suspect seems to be something like the
[Omron G5LE-1A4 DC12][1], which costs US$1.30 in quantity 1 and
switches 10 amps at up to 250 VAC when you apply 12 VDC and 33.3mA to
the coil.  It’s SPST, normally open.  Or the [TE Connectivity/Brumfield
OJE-SH-112HM,000][2], apparently identical in every way except for
costing US$1.32 and drawing 37.5 mA.

However, the Omron datasheet has a chart that shows durability of
200 000 operations at 3 amps and a 250 VAC resistive load or 120 VAC
inductive load.  With a 120 VAC resistive load, it’s rated for twice
the lifetime.  The TE relay is only rated for 10 000 ops, though
there’s an “LM” variant rated to 100k.

All four relays at once would only be 133 milliamps, well within the
ULN2003’s limits.

There do exist mercury-wetted reed relays with lifetimes of a million
operations, but these probably aren’t necessary for a lifetime of one
year.

Some kind of triac-optoisolator thing might be a reasonable
alternative, but a typical triac drops 1.5 volts, so 3 amps would
dissipate 5 watts, requiring a hefty heatsink and posing potential
reliability problems of its own.

ULN2003 hookup
--------------

The ULN2003 only has a guaranteed β of 1000, so getting 33 milliamps
on its output requires 33 microamps on its input.  Except that
actually the curves in the datasheet show that you need over 100
microamps to get anything to happen.  This means that, at 3.3 V, the
base resistor shouldn’t be over 33 kilohms, which means you can’t
quite use the pullup resistors integrated in the STM32 I/O pins, since
they could be as high as 50 kΩ according to the datasheet.  You could
maybe parallel two I/O pins, but it would probably be better to use
external resistors, thus avoiding the chance of a software error
burning up the STM32 or the ULN2003.

The ULN2003’s maximum base current is 25 mA; 1 mA per pin should be
plenty, so anything between 3.3kΩ and 33kΩ is adequate.  10kΩ,
everybody’s favorite resistor, is probably optimal, giving 330 μA, and
thus 330 mA or better on the output pin.

Speaker
-------

We can hook up a speaker to an extra output of the ULN2003 and control
it through the built-in PWM of the STM32.  If it’s a ¼W 8Ω speaker, we
need to keep current through it under about 100mA; a dc-blocking
capacitor is probably worthwhile here, so that if the ULN2003 is on we
don’t have a constant current through the speaker with no sound, but
also it would be a good idea to limit the current of ac signals and
also perhaps filter out inaudible high frequencies.  More precisely,
with 8Ω, to keep I²R < ¼W we need |I| < 177 mA, so a series resistance
of 68Ω or greater is called for with 12V.  Except with dc-blocking
that’s 12V P-t-P, so 6V RMS with a perfect square wave, so 33Ω would
be adequate.  The resistor is going to have most of that 6V RMS across
it, like about 5V, so it needs to be pretty hefty, nearly a watt in
the worst case.  Probably prudent to limit the output power further,
using 100Ω or so.

At 100Ω series resistance, an instantaneous 12V spike would push
120 mA, and 6V RMS would dissipate 360 mW in the resistor, which
requires a largish resistor but nothing ridiculous; it would
experience spikes to 1.3 watts.  The 60 mA RMS would output 29 mW from
the 8Ω speaker.  You can see why people prefer to drive these damn
things through transformers.  Still, 29 mW is probably still audible;
it’s less than 10 dB below what I guessed was the maximum output for
the speaker.

Now, what about filtering out ultrasound?  If we shunt the speaker
with a capacitor, we’d like its RC time constant to be in the tens of
microseconds somewhere, so that 64 kHz (2.5 μs per radian) is strongly
attenuated but 10 kHz (15.9 μs per radian) is minimally attenuated, if
at all.  But the relevant R here is not the 100Ω that’s being used to
limit the current, but rather the parallel combination of that 100Ω
(plus the dc-blocking capacitor, which is hopefully negligible at the
relevant frequencies) and the 8Ω of the speaker, which works out to be
7.4Ω.  So we need something like 1.3 μF, not the 100 nF you would
expect.  At 1 μF, we get 7.4 μs, which puts the knee around 21 kHz,
which means that we only have about 3× attenuation at 64 kHz (like
10 dB).  If we use 2.2 μF, the knee is at 9.8 kHz, which gives us an
extra 6 dB.

The dc-blocking capacitor needs to have a sufficiently long time
constant with the series resistance to not mess up the bass too bad.
Say we want its time constant to be below 40 Hz (4 ms per radian),
then we need at least 40 μF.  100 μF is probably fine; at 12 volts
this holds 7.2 mJ, which is what gets dissipated in that 1.3-W spike
in the series resistance.

Perhaps a second RC section is worthwhile in this case: 10 ohms before
the 100 ohms, then a 1μF to ground.  So the whole output circuit from
the ULN2003 pin would be `{ 100 μF 10 Ω { 1 μF gnd } 100 Ω (1 μF ||
speaker) 12 V }`, where concatenation is series combination, `{}` is a
branch, `()` are grouping, and `||` is parallel combination.  In a
Falstad simulation, this configuration gives us about -4 dB at 40 Hz,
-0 dB from 80 Hz to 5 kHz, -1 dB at 7.5 kHz, -2 dB at 10 kHz, -4 dB at
15 kHz, -5 dB at 20 kHz, -15 dB at 40 kHz, and -22 dB at 65 kHz.
However, at high frequencies, this puts the whole 6 V RMS across this
new 10Ω resistor through the capacitor shunt to ground, which means it
will be dissipating 3.6 watts!  And of course the PWM output from the
ULN2003 is *always* close to 6 V RMS, except when it’s close to dc.

So the second RC section is a bad idea.  Probably much less hassle to
use an inductor in series with the resistor, one whose impedance
becomes large relative to 100 ohms at somewhere around 10 kHz, like a
4.7mH inductor.  In a Falstad simulation, this gives about 3 dB
attenuation at 3.5 kHz, 6 dB at 6.3 kHz, 10 dB at 10 kHz, 17 dB at 20
kHz, 27 dB at 40 kHz, 30 dB at 48 kHz, 38 dB at 80 kHz, and 42 dB at
99 kHz.  Simulation also suggests about a 13.7 mV peak amplitude part
of a 48 kHz PWM modulating square wave would remain across the
terminals of the speaker, compared to some 440 mV peak for the actual
signal.  (Maybe it works even better with L speaker || C instead of L
(speaker || C), with a +6dB peak around 6kHz.)

Wait, actually the whole thing is bad in that form.  I need a 220Ω
pullup resistor on the ULN2003 to get current.  And then maybe I don’t
really need an inductor.  Here’s the Falstad design:

Oh, I think I have a reasonable approach that eliminates most of the
inefficiencies.  `{100Ω (L || 100μF speaker) 12V}`, where the L
provides a dc path around the speaker and capacitor, and the capacitor
basically just protects the speaker from dc.  The resistor in series
with the whole shebang limits the current, but maybe it could be
bypassed with a capacitor so that it can be bigger than would be
desirable for ac.  And you can still shunt the speaker alone with a
capacitor to reduce ultrasound.

A potential problem with this is that it could introduce a kind of
distortion when the conduction switches from being through the
Darlington to being through the freewheel diode, just because of the
forward voltage drop of the freewheel diode.

How much inductance does the shunt inductor need?  Ideally it
shouldn’t steal much current from the speaker at audio frequencies,
which means its impedance at audio frequencies should be large
compared to the speaker’s 8Ω, although maybe the capacitor can help
compensate for this.  But let’s say we want its impedance at 40 Hz to
be 16Ω.  This requires a fairly hefty 68-mH inductor (like, 8 mm ×
12 mm.)

Or you could just drive the speaker through a little 4:1 100Ω-ESR
audio-frequency transformer, which will probably filter out the
ultrasound as a side effect.

What *is* the PWM frequency?  The STM32F030x4 etc. reference manual
RM0360 says, “If the APB prescaler is 1, the timer clock frequencies
are set to the same frequency as that of the APB domain,” which is
normally 48MHz except for power saving.  I think that means that if
you want 8-bit PWM, you can get 187.5 kHz PWM.  At such a speed, 1mH
of inductance should be plenty — and how much does the speaker itself
have?  1mH series and 1μF in parallel reduces the 187.5 kHz square
wave to 5.6 mV peak, while the AF signal is like 440 mV peak.

Display
-------

A Nokia 5110 84×48 display ought to be adequate and might fit in well
with the overall feeling of the device, although OLEDs are nicer on
several axes nowadays.

Sensors
-------

Monarca sells a [DHT-22 temperature and humidity sensor for $220][3].
[Nubbeo has the cheaper DHT-11 for $60][4], but its precision is ±2°,
which would be terrible for the Nutra, restricting it to a temperature
of 40° or below.  By contrast, the DHT-22’s precision is ±0.1°.

Apart from cost and precision, the sensors are otherwise quite
similar.

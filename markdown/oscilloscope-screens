I was thinking it would be pretty nifty to rig up something like the
displays in Brazil using a big Fresnel lens and an old analog
oscilloscope tube.  The benchmark here is maybe the TX-2 display used
to develop Sketchpad and GENESYS in the 1960s: 1024×1024 with a single
brightness, a limited range of color (blue initially, yellow
afterglow), typically less than 32768 points lit, and I think 100 000
points per second (?).

If we were to drive a 20MHz oscilloscope with the analog VGA signal
from a modern video card, we could probably actually do better than
that.  The video card can produce about 72 *million* points per
second, about 720 times greater than the TX-2, and has memory for a
bit over a million of them, about 32 times greater.  The tube becomes
the limiting factor — if we figure that it can be persuaded to go to
an arbitrary spot on the display 40 million times a second, perhaps
with a bit of filtering to compensate for the 3dB attenuation and
phase shift at that point, that’s one limitation.  But that still
means we could paint every point on the display 40 times a
second — the slow phosphor becomes an even bigger limitation.  And it
probably doesn’t have 1024×1024 faceplate resolution, maybe more like
512×512 if we’re lucky.

A possibly more entertaining approach is to allocate, say, 100k points
to each of many oscilloscopes, and refresh them each at, say,
10 Hz — with a fast enough switch you could multiplex one pixel to
each display and thus drive 72 oscilloscopes off a single video card,
but it’s probably easier to switch a 20MHz signal to each display for
the requisite 2.5 milliseconds out of every 100, limiting you to 40
oscilloscopes but allowing you to use a 4kHz multiplexing switch.

If you wanted to drive them all from a single frame — so you didn’t
have to synchronize your page flips with the switch — you could still
drive about 10 oscilloscopes.

In a relentlessly monomorphic language with good type safety, you
could imagine reducing the size of object pointers to the size needed
to distinguish the members of their class.  If there are never more
than 16 Rectangle objects, for example, you don’t need more than 4
bits to identify a Rectangle; you can store their xmin, ymin, xmax,
and ymax attributes in arrays of size 16.  This is actually a
practical thing to do in Verilog, where you actually can have a 9-bit
variable (as opposed to a 16-bit one).

Now, maybe your Rectangle object is instead actually made of Point
objects ul and lr.  If you want to pass the ids of those Point objects
to Point functions, you have two options:

1. The Fortran option: make the x and y attribute arrays of the Point
   class explicit parameters to the Point function.

2. The Smalltalk option: store all the Point attributes in the usual
   Point attribute arrays, then put the ids of the Points in question
   into ul and lr.

So far so good, although in #2 maybe you are spending more space on
the Point pointers than on the Rectangle pointers.

Okay, now here’s a thing that bothers me.  What do I do if I want
parametric polymorphism?  Consider the case of an 'a list made out of
car and cdr attributes, where the car has type 'a and the cdr has type
'a list, and where maybe we use -1 or something for a null cdr.  Can I
write a polymorphic list length function?

I have somewhat corresponding options.

If I have a Rectangle list type, for example, its car array can be of
4-bit Rectangle ids, in an alternative analogous to #1.  But the
length function doesn’t actually use that array at all; it only needs
the corresponding cdr array.  So that works fine.  In an alternative
analogous to #2, I store all types of 'a list in the same car and cdr
array, so the car array needs to be wide enough to accommodate
pointers to any object type.

Up to a quarter megahertz, [ultrasound attenuates in air][0] at about
20dB/ft/MHz, which is 66dB/m/MHz.  The Airy limit is sin θ = 1.220λ/D
for a circular aperture.  Mach 1 is 331 m/s.

Could you do passive ultrasound sonar at a reasonable resolution?  At
100kHz you have 6.6dB/m of attenuation, so you only have about 20
meters of range where a detectable amount of sound is going to reach
you.  λ = 3.3 mm, so the Airy limit for a 100mm aperture is 0.040
radians, about 2.3 degrees.  You’d need a much larger aperture to get
close to the theoretical far-field limit of what 100kHz could resolve.

At a higher frequency, like 1MHz, you only have a couple of meters of
range, so you’d have to get super lucky to have an ultrasound source
in range.  1MHz in air has a 330-micron wavelength, so your limit
would be 4.2 milliradians, about a quarter of a degree, and then you
really could see stuff with subcentimeter resolution at a meter of
distance or so.  But in practice you probably need an active
ultrasound source for that.

The 20mm PVC pipe I tried to use for the Fuego Austral dome wasn’t
stiff enough to support much weight, let alone wind loading; it
supported maybe 10kg above and beyond its own weight at the crossing
of three pipes in the center of the six-pointed star dome.  It was 1mm
thick and cost AR$27 (US$1.80) for three meters.  The largest pipes
available in the category were 46.8 mm inside diameter, 50.8 mm
outside diameter, and are thus 2mm thick: twice the wall thickness,
2.4 times the lever arm, and 2.4 times the perimeter, for a product of
11.5 times stiffer.  I’m not absolutely sure, but I think it cost
AR$95 for three meters, 3.5 times more cost (and thus 3.3 times more
cost-effective at buying stiffness), and would have weighed 4.8 times
as much per three meters.  11.5 times stiffer would imply it could
carry about 110 kg of load at the center of the dome.

I paid some AR$700 for 26 three-meter lengths of the 20mm pipe.  At
AR$95 per three-meter length, this would be AR$2470 (US$164).  Adding
the AR$1450 cost of the 81 square meters of used advertising vinyl we
bought to cover it, the total comes to some AR$4000 (US$263).  This
amount of vinyl is a bit of overkill: only 57 square meters should be
necessary, costing only AR$1026.  But then, the whole design is kind
of overkill.

The longer lever arm means that the roughly 500mm radius of curvature
I established in destructive testing in Parque Lezama would be about
1.2 m.  This still seems like a pretty tight curve: a
2.4-meter-diameter circle is quite tight compared to the 6-meter
diameter of the desired dome.  Thicker pipe walls would help more with
resilience; spreading the same material over more area would help more
with stiffness.

If this amount of pipe encloses a 5-meter-diameter circle of
effectively usable floor space, that’s 19.6 square meters of floor
space, at a cost of about US$13 per square meter.

How does this compare to the cost of a hexayurt?
------------------------------------------------

A standard 18-panel H18 12-foot hexayurt is 8 feet (2.4 m) on each
hexagonal side and 2.4 meters tall at the inside of the wall; I
suppose that means it's 2.1 meters from the center to a wall, making
its interior consist of six 2.1-meter-height, 2.4-meter-base
triangles, for a total of 15.4 square meters of usable floor space.
<http://www.appropedia.org/Category:Hexayurt_project> says it costs
“around [US]$300 per unit”.  It originally used 1" (25mm) Tuff-R
foil-faced polyisocyanurate foam panels, according to
<http://www.appropedia.org/Hexayurt_playa#Which_Hexayurt.3F>, but
<http://www.appropedia.org/Hexayurt_Safety_Information> says that’s a
fire risk.  Also apparently the necessary four rolls of tape cost like
US$150, and FOAMULAR 150 panels of 1" thickness (without even the
aluminum facer!)  currently costs US$19 at Home Depot, for US$342
total cost for the foam and thus US$490 for the total hexayurt,
US$31/m².  This is about 2.4× the cost of the dome.  (Rmax
Thermasheath-3 1-inch 4'×8' R-6 polyisocyanurate panels with aluminum
facers cost US$19.25 each at the Emeryville Home Depot, so this is
probably actually about the right cost.)

Another interesting comparison is the weight.  The dome probably
weighs about twice the weight of its vinyl coating, which is, say,
400g/m²; that's 22.8kg of vinyl in the dome, or about 46kg total, or
2.3kg/m² of usable floor.  The Thermasheath-3 boards weigh 7 pounds
each, according to
<http://www.homedepot.com/p/Thermasheath-Rmax-Thermasheath-3-1-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-R-6-Polyisocyanurate-Rigid-Foam-Insulation-Board-787264/100549260>,
which works out to 57kg, or about 3.7kg/m² of usable floor.

So, this dome is several times cheaper than a hexayurt and a bit
lighter, but it might also be significantly less livable because it
provides little to no insulation.  A closer comparison might be a
plywood hexayurt, which is US$132 for those same 15.4m².

A minimal-cost composite dome covering might consist of Tyvek, Mylar,
and bubble wrap.  I don’t know if this can get near the cost of
AR$18/m² (US$1.20/m²) that we’re paying for used opaque billboard
covering, but I suspect so.

<http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-611584214-cinta-de-aluminio-puro-de-30-micrones-ideal-para-aislacion-_JM>
offers 30-micron aluminum reflecting tape for AR$400 per roll of
45 m × 48 mm, a product of 2.16m².

<http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-612633055-membrana-burbuja-10mm-aluminizada-aislante-termico-_JM>
is 3.5mm-thick aluminized bubble-wrap membrane for insulating uses for
AR$289, 1m × 15m, or AR$19/m².  It says “10mm” in the description, but
this is misleading; that’s the diameter of the bubbles.

<http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-604333399-aislante-aislacion-termica-para-techos-rollo-x-25-m2-_JM>
is a roll of 25m² of bubble wrap (polyethylene, I suppose) without an
aluminum facing for AR$121, or AR$4.84/m².  No thickness is specified,
but I suspect 3.5mm.

<http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-612656558-membrana-aislante-espuma-tipo-isolant-tba10-10mm-aluminizada-_JM>
is a 1m × 20mm roll of 10mm-thick aluminized flexible polyethylene
foam for AR$530, or AR$26.50/m².

<http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-614120886-aislante-termico-burbujas-aluminizado-20-m2-_JM>
is 19.4m² of 3.5mm-thick aluminized bubble wrap for AR$320, or
AR$16.50/m².  This is probably the best bet so far.

Various space-blanket products on Mercado Libre are about 4m² for
about AR$150, or about AR$40/m².  It seems like aluminized Mylar ought
to be available for less money, but I’m not seeing where.

One of the geodesic domes I saw at Fuego Austral was covered with
silage plastic (for covering heaps of grains).  This is perfectly
opaque and airtight, and it’s white to keep down solar heating of the
grain pile.  It seems likely to have a lower cost per square meter
than other reflective, opaque substances;
<http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-614005553-bolsa-para-silo-agrinplex-9x60-f-forraje-segura-_JM>
is a bag of such plastic of 9 feet diameter and 60 meters of length,
“Agrinplex” brand, for AR$7000.  (Silobolsa and Siloplast are two
other brands.)  If we figure that 9 feet diameter means 28 meters of
circumference, which is 8.6 meters, that’s 517 m², or AR$13.50/m².  If
combined with bubble wrap, it might make an adequate dome covering.
However, it’s probably not as strong or stiff as Tyvek.

<http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-614441671-tyvek-rollo-130-x-12-m-_JM>
is a 1.3 m × 12 m roll of Tyvek for AR$479, or AR$30.70/m².  This by
itself is considerably more expensive than the billboard vinyl it
replaces in this use.

<http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-614133525-wichi-roofing-igual-a-tyvek-membrana-hidrofuga-x-m2-_JM>
is a 1.16 m × 26 m roll of off-brand Tyvek clone (“Wichi” brand) for
AR$484, or AR$16/m², about the same cost as the billboard vinyl.

<http://articulo.mercadolibre.com.ar/MLA-606787652-tyvek-aislacion-hidrofuga-techo-superior-a-ruberoid-_JM>
is a 1 m × 30 m roll of Tyvek for AR$1050, or AR$35/m².  It gives the
weight of the roll as 2.8kg, or 93 g/m².  This is something like 20%
of the weight of the billboard vinyl (the vendors say 30%, but my
tired back says otherwise, although maybe the vinyl was wet or
something.)  The publication clarifies that it's 100% HDPE and weighs
80.6 g/m² (maybe the other 12g/m² is the cardboard it's wound around)
and is 220μm thick.

Stuff I've posted to kragen-tol over the years about post-HTTP
==============================================================

I've argued that we need a browser that supports accessing resources
stored in decentralized content stores like Tahoe-LAFS or Git, rather
than named according to a path defined by the administrator of a
particular domain name over time.  I haven't done a very good job
of gathering my thoughts on the matter into one place yet.

This all seems a little silly, given that other people have contributed
so much more to solving this problem than I have, but there may be one
or two things in here that aren't currently easy to find, but that are
important.

I've only dug through the archives back to 2000.  There might be stuff in 1998 or 1999
that's relevant, but surely not very important.

Reasons why

I still haven't published the second half, and it needs thorough revision now.

### ["The equivalent of free software for online services"][2] ###

Explains why it's crucial to implement communication systems as cooperating software
running on users' computers, rather than on centralized servers.

> So people use free software because of its guaranteed low cost, because
> it does what its users want, and because it's trustworthy.  And they use
> web services because they get low system administration costs, they can
> use huge databases without downloading them first, they can get software
> updates quickly, they can do very-CPU-intensive things, and they can
> collaborate with their friends easily.  How can we get both of these
> sets of advantages at once?
> 
> I think there is only one solution: build these services as
> decentralized free-software peer-to-peer applications, pieces of which

> failure in the system somewhere outside your control, its owner is in a

> 
> So we need a platform, something like a web browser, that supports a
> universe of constantly-changing code written by a multitude of authors,
> which migrates to where it's being used, and simultaneously supports

There's actually a lot of detail in this essay about specifically how you
could structure such a system.

Things contributing to building the solution
--------------------------------------------

There's a lot of software out there now that wasn't there when I wrote
this stuff; I should probably make a list of it here too.  See above,
too, the item about "The equivalent of free software for online services."

### ["Imagine decentralizing Wikipedia with Codeville"][4] ###

Codeville was an early decentralized version control system, like Git or
Mercurial, that didn't take off.  Functionally the systems are equivalent:
they replicate the entire version history to every user and provide hash-based
retrieval.

### ["DHTML persistence: a design for a generic Ajax server-side"][5] ###

Probably the first essay I wrote advocating what we were doing at KnowNow in 2000,
which kind of went mainstream in 2004 with Gmail and 2005 with Google Maps:
putting all the application logic on the client side in JavaScript, relegating the
server to basically being a dumb data store.  Once you do this, of course, you no
longer need a server as such; you need a dumb data store, which can be provided by
a peer-to-peer network — but this essay doesn't talk about that at all.

I'm not convinced that I actually achieved a usable protocol design here.

> In my view, the most sensible thing to do is to write the application

### ["Decentralized chat using CouchDB"][6] ###

> I was just chatting with Noah on IRC about how IRC sucks and we need
> to replace it and whether we could do that using CouchDB.

More broadly, what's needed for decentralized secure chat, which is to say, 
pub/sub, or event notification.  Pub/sub is one of the fundamental services
needed for distributed, including decentralized, applications.

CouchDB is one of the current systems that contemplates Lotus-Notes-style
mobile-code secure applications, which it calls CouchApps.  Unfortunately,
I think the discussion that followed this email showed that it's not
capable of providing the kind of support for secure collaboration that we
need — its security model is too simple.

### ["distributed posting list joins"][7] ###

One of the hardest problems in decentralized systems is how to query a decentralized
database with acceptable efficiency.  In this post, I finally found a solution that
allows you to build a *distributed *if not decentralized full-text web search engine.
This followed some work in <http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-tol/2004-February/thread.html>.

I actually wrote some things kind of like this, but never built the full system
described.  In fact I never finished describing it :(  But it's kind of like
CouchDB or Meteor.

### ["mailing lists, blog posts, and Git: what to do next with kragen-tol?"][10] ###

Lamenting that neither Git nor the Web provide distributed autentication
of publication date, which is a thing I want for kragen-tol, which is why
kragen-tol is still a mailing list.

### ["web services, operations as a strategic advantage, and decentralization"][11] ###

Suggesting that if we can decentralize web services onto individual users'
machines, then maybe we'll be able to reduce deployment headaches.  In retrospect,
I think this is kind of a dead end — instead we have devops — but it contains 
the concept.

Describes web browsers as "mere conduits" for information; suggests
content-centric networking.

### ["offline web reading"][13] ###

Nothing earthshaking but does mention I was able to use Google Maps offline
with WWWOFFLE because of its RESTian architecture.

Lots of images in the modern world are overlaid with some kind of
regular screen pattern.  Halftoned images from newspapers, posters,
and magazines; images printed on woven cloth or art paper with cloth
imprinted on it; images photographed through window screens, security
grilles, or microwave oven doors; signs printed on cloth-backed vinyl,
illuminated from behind; GIFs using patterned dither; woodcut and
metal engraving images; bus-window advertising, with its pattern of
regular holes; shadow-mask and Trinitron patterns from CRTs;
pixel-grid patterns from LCD matrices, especially low-resolution ones;
silkscreened images with incomplete coverage; objects seen through
mostly-opaque cloth; patterns of illumination on woven and nonwoven
cloth and legs wearing fishnet stockings.  Additionally, there are
one-dimensional equivalents — PWM signals, audio distorted by
clipping, and AM radio.

I suspect that these patterns are amenable to a number of interesting
image-processing and other signal-processing algorithms.

Dehalftoning
------------

### Traditional newsprint monochrome halftone ###

A classic newspaper-article monochrome halftone image consists of a
square lattice of black dots on a white background, rotated to some
odd angle to minimize aliasing artifacts, whose varying diameters give
varying “tones”, which is to say brightnesses, to different areas of
the image.  In blacker areas, the dots lose their roundness and start
to merge together, leaving isolated white dots, which start to become
round.

In the frequency domain, we can analyze a small area of the image as
containing some DC level, plus “dithering noise” added by the
halftoning, which is entirely concentrated in the even harmonics of
two spatial frequencies, one 90° rotated from the other but otherwise
identical — the frequencies of the warp and weft of the halftone
screen.  If we look at different small areas of the image, the
amplitudes (but not the phases) of these harmonics vary (in varying,
non-monotonic ways) with the DC level; looking at a larger area of the
image, this amplitude modulation manifests as sidebands on the
“carrier signal”.

The underlying process is not simply AM; the carrier signal is *added
to* the underlying image gray level, and then the sum is thresholded
(originally, through nonlinear chemical processing).  The result has a
maximum carrier amplitude at 50% gray, and zero carrier amplitude at
either pure white or pure black; the second harmonic of the carrier is
zero at pure white, pure black, and 50% gray, while reaching amplitude
maxima at 25% and 75%, I think; and higher harmonics vary in ampitude
more rapidly.

XXX even in one dimension, the Nth harmonic has N maxima and N+1
nulls; the odd harmonics are not missing (except at 50%!) so the below
algorithm is wrong (and probably something simpler is doable)

### Linearly, shift-invariantly dehalftoning the newspaper ###

Given the carrier frequency and angle, it is fairly straightforward to
construct a zero-phase linear filter kernel that sharply notches out
the carrier frequency itself and precisely its even harmonics, leaving
just the information-carrying sidebands, using filter inversion.  The
filter for the even harmonics is a (“feedback”) comb filter; spatially
it looks like a square grid of points (positive impulses) at the same
angle as the halftone screen and twice its frequency; the filter for
the fundamental looks like the heights of egg-carton foam, also making
a square grid at the same angle, but without impulses or sharp edges;
and inverting either of those turns it negative and adds a new, much
stronger positive impulse in the center.

The convolution of these two notch filters provides a filter that
eliminates the halftone screen entirely.  However, without any spatial
windowing, they only remove the part without any spatial variation
whatsoever; you need to window them down to a spatially reasonable
area, for example with a Gaussian window, in order to remove the
harmonics that are prevalent in a given area.

This filter might still seem to have alarmingly large support for
practical spatial-domain convolution, but due to its special
structure, the multiplication-free sparse-kernel-cascade techniques
described in file `sparse-kernel-cascade-gabor-approximation` can
compute convolutions with it very inexpensively.

There’s one problem left over: DC is an even harmonic of the
halftone-screen frequency — the zeroth harmonic — so the even-harmonic
filter removes the DC signal we wanted to save, and we’re left with
only edges detected.  To solve this problem it is necessary to
high-pass-filter the even-harmonic-selecting kernel so that its DC
response is zero, or at least less than ½ or so, ideally without
affecting its relative response to the other harmonics.  This is
clearly doable by, for example, bidirectionally filtering the signal
the even-harmonic filter detected with a high-pass Chebyshev filter
before subtracting it from the original image pixel to invert it; but
it’s not immediately evident to me if there’s a way to do it with the
sparse multiplication-free approach.

The frequency-selectivity of this approach should give much better
high-frequency response than the usual approach of just blurring the
image — that is to say, it should preserve edges that are close to the
frequency of the halftoning screen itself, and even those that are
higher, assuming the halftoning approach is the traditional
photographic analog approach, from which the dots can come out
off-center and non-round.

#### Minor nonlinear enhancement ####

If the resolution is high enough, the intendedly-bilevel nature of the
halftoned image can be used to nonlinearly correct some other errors:
uneven illumination, uneven paper color, and uneven ink blackness can
all be corrected by contrast-stretching the image with locally-varying
black and white levels; a bit of morphological opening and closing
might help due to the intendedly-contiguous nature of the halftone
dots.  Doing this for CMYK images is more complex, due to the 16
possible combinations of ink colors, but is certainly possible with
high enough resolution.

Some kind of nonlinear preprocessing is probably needed for CMYK
images, because each color channel is normally printed with the
halftoning screen at a different angle in order to reduce aliasing
artifacts, and the inks interact nonlinearly (though I conjecture that
in a negative image they might be closer to linearity).  So you need
to recover some kind of per-color-channel estimate before you go
trying to dehalftone.

### Linearly, shift-invariantly dehalftoning other images ###

The other kinds of images I mentioned above — backlit images printed
on cloth-backed vinyl, images printed on Lambertian cloth, images with
CRT shadow-mask patterns, and so on — mostly don’t have the pattern of
modulation of harmonics that characterizes the kind of screen
halftoning used by newspapers and magazines.  Instead, they have a
grid pattern whose amplitude is multiplied by the image, pixel by
pixel, without modulating the spatial spectrum of the grid pattern
(unless there’s sensor saturation, say).  Nevertheless, the same
linear filter should work.

This process is a much purer spatial equivalent of amplitude
modulation as used in radio, although the carrier signal is not
sinusoidal, and the baseband signal is still present; in general it
consists of all the harmonics of two spatial frequencies, which is to
say, the lattice generated by two vectors in frequency space.

### Morphologically, shift-invariantly dehalftoning those images ###

In these cases, it ought to be possible to morphologically open or
close the image in order to reduce the halftoning
artifacts — depending on whether the artifacts are dark, as they
usually are, or light, as in a photo taken through a window screen.
This approach won’t work (or will work very poorly) with newspaper
halftoning, because the image data isn’t encoded in the brightness or
color of what is seen through the screen, but of the size of the
“apertures”.  But for linearly-encoded data like this, it ought to
work well.

This is closely analogous to how a crystal radio set demodulates AM
radio, though without a tuner: the nonlinearity of the diode detector
spreads the peak of the detected wave across the valleys in between.

### Chroma subsampling ###

CRT and (low-resolution) LCD images are somewhat special among
linearly-encoded halftoned images in that they have, effectively,
color filters — the red, green, blue, and sometimes white subpixels
are each limited in what colors they can carry.  Nevertheless, in CRTs
and in LCDs using subpixel rendering, they are used to carry both
chroma and brightness information, relying on the lower resolution
accorded to chroma information by the eyes of the humans.

Probably the best solution here is to do the dehalftoning process
entirely in brightness-space, then add blurred chroma information to
it afterwards.

### Non-shift-invariant dehalftoning ###

A potentially more interesting approach is to try to identify which
pixels depend on the “underlying image” and which are just part of the
halftone screen and should be filled in based on some kind of filling
operation from the underlying image (whether via mathematical
morphology or some kind of more elaborate texture-synthesis
algorithm).  This is likely to work a lot better for, for example,
photos taken through security grilles or microwave oven doors, than
the algorithms above.

Low-resolution images are likely to have a lot of mixed pixels, so the
model needs to handle partly-screen pixels.

The simplest kind of model here is one that estimates the phase,
angle, and perhaps waveform of the screen; then multiplies the image
by it pixel-by-pixel to selectively amplify the underlying image; then
blurs that image or comb-filters out the screen frequency, as before,
to estimate the underlying image.  This is precisely analogous to an
AM radio receiver mixing with a local oscillator.

Video or stereo data is probably very useful for these models, since
correlations over time or over viewpoints will tend to separate the
underlying image from the screen.

### Optimization-based approaches ###

Given a computation that generates a halftoned image from an
underlying image and other parameters such as halftone-screen angle
and phase, an error metric accounting for the likelihood of things
like sensor noise and ink squeeze, and a prior probability
distribution over underlying images, you can use a generic
high-dimensional optimization algorithm such as the popular variants
of gradient descent to infer likely underlying images.

(See file `image-approximation` for more explorations along these
lines.)

Image separation by demodulation
--------------------------------

Consider a photo taken through a microwave-oven door.  Most of the
image consists of a reflection of the room behind the camera, but
through the holes in the RF shielding grille we can see the scene
inside the microwave.

As I said above, the inside scene is an amplitude-modulated signal,
and we can recover it in the usual way, by mixing with a local
oscillator or morphologically “rectifying” it, and then filtering out
the carrier.  However, another alternative is to filter out the
carrier *and the sidebands*, leaving only the reflection of the room.

An improved estimate of either the baseband non-modulated image of the
room or of the interior, amplitude-modulated image, allows us to do a
better job of canceling its contribution to the combined image,
getting a better estimate of the other image.  In this way we can, to
a significant extent, separate the original combined image into its
constituent layers.

(The same approach can be used, of course, with temporally-modulated
illumination; in a loose sense this is the basis of structured-light
3-D scanning.)

### Canceling reflections of amplitude-modulated textures ###

As another example of the same phenomenon, on the bus home, there was
an illuminated sign indicating which branch of the line the bus was
serving, made of fabric-backed vinyl and illuminated from within.
This sign was just inside the windshield, near the bottom, so it
created a strong reflection on the windshield, obscuring the image of
the road.

With this approach, it should be possible to subtract the
cloth-modulated reflection and see the road — if JPEG compression
doesn’t get to your image first and erase the subliminal road data.

### Detecting amplitude-modulated textures in superimposed images ###

Consider instead looking out the window of a café where the sun is
falling on a table.  The newspaper on the table, lit by the sun, is
reflected in the window; its reflection is superimposed on the image
of the tree outside the window.  Can you recover the newspaper
front-page photo from a high-resolution combined image?

Newspaper halftoning has the solarization ambiguity I mentioned
earlier — the spatial frequency spectra are symmetric around 50% gray.
But, in theory, even the fundamental frequency and its second harmonic
are sufficient to recover the gray level up to that ambiguity — but
only if you know beforehand how strong they would be at their
strongest.  The third and fourth harmonics help further, because their
own minima allow us to precisely calibrate the strength of the first
and second harmonics.

(I say “minima” because the nulls are far sharper than the maxima,
being as they are the crossing of a sinusoid with the X-axis, while
the maxima are the peaks of those sinusoids.)

A similar problem is removing glare from a photograph of a glossy
magazine.  If the sensor didn’t saturate and the photo didn’t suffer
lossy compression, the halftone-frequency information in the glare
area contains most of the information, again up to the solarization
ambiguity.

All of these presuppose that you can perspective-correct the image and
obtain a reasonably correct estimate of the halftoning frequencies and
angles, of course.

For mesh sizes below about 200 μm, diffraction starts to become a
problem, and geometric-optics-based algorithms become increasingly
inaccurate.  The Airy radius sin *θ* = 1.22*λ*/*D* of a 100-mm mirror
at 555 nm is 6.7 μradians, which means that from more than about 30
meters away, a 100-mm mirror or lens can’t image through a 200-μm
hole; the mirror itself is visible, subtending about 0.2°, half the
apparent size of the sun or moon.  More-distant sensors would need to
be proportionally larger.  So you don’t need to worry about drones too
far away for you to see using these algorithms to see through your
bedroom curtains.

Humans are most comfortable when the air they are breathing is
substantially cooler than the radiant temperature of their
environment.  If both are at 19–24°, humans can be reasonably
comfortable, but it’s better to have the radiant temperature at some
40° and the air temperature closer to 20°.

This, of course, implies some kind of continuous energy
input — supplied by the sun in our natural environment, whose "solar
constant" is 1000 W/m².  If the radiant temperature is 40°, without
any cooling, things will gradually heat up to 40°, and humans will
feel like shit.  The air inside a building itself doesn’t absorb a
substantial amount of radiant energy at thermal IR wavelengths, but
surfaces will — even with low-emissivity coatings, they will absorb at
least 10% of the incident radiation, which is the radiation they would
be emitting at 40° — that’s 545 W/m² for a black body, 54.5 W/m² for
one whose emissivity at the relevant wavelengths is 0.1.  And the 1000
W/m² of the solar constant works out to a radiant temperature of some
91°.

54 W/m² is a relatively reasonable amount of heat to remove through
airflow and air conditioning, especially compared to the 1000 W/m²
supplied by the sun shining through an open window.  What does it look
like to supply it through radiant heaters?

Note that you have to have the whole 545 W/m² incident on your body
for the radiant temperature to be 40°.  But only some of it has to
come directly from the radiant heaters; other parts can be reflected,
or even emitted, by other materials in your environment.  So let’s
consider what it takes to reach 150 W/m² on the floor directly from
ceiling-mounted radiant heaters radiating down.

High-emissivity heating elements that can reach 900° without damage
are commonplace.  Higher-temperature materials, like the Kanthals, are
somewhat expensive.  900° is 107 kW/m², while 1400° (about as high as
any Kanthal goes) is 440 kW/m².  So each cm² of 900° heater radiator
can cover 720 cm² of floor with 150 W/m².  To cover a whole 40m²
efficiency apartment, you need 560 cm² of 900° heating elements to
emit the requisite 6 kW (requiring 25 A at 240 V to produce it through
Joule heating).

If you instead use coolant from a phase-change reservoir at, say, 500°
(not sure what material melts at 500°, but I’m sure there’s
something), it only emits 20 kW/m², so you need 3000 cm² (0.3 m²) of
emitting panels.

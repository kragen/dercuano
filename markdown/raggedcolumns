The standard C way of doing two-dimensional arrays accommodates two
possibilities in the same syntax `c[i][j]`: arrays of arrays like
`int c[10][7];` and arrays of pointers like `int *c[10];`.  The first
representation wastes no memory on pointers, but requires each row to
be the same length, while the second one allows each row to be of a
different length, but spends a pointer and often a dynamic memory
allocation on each row.  Also, it needs to store the lengths of the
rows somewhere, unless they're NUL-terminated strings or something,
which has problems of its own.  So the overhead is something like two
or three words per row.

Historically, array languages like APL and libraries like Numpy have
preferred rectangular N-dimensional arrays rather than ragged ones.
This isn't ideal for things like lists of strings, where each string
may be of a different size.  I've been thinking about how to extend
array languages consistently to such objects, both in abstract
semantics and in practical machine implementation.

Speaking of practical implementation, it occurred to me that if your N
rows are stored one after another in a contiguous block, as in the C
array-of-arrays case, but you have a pointer to the beginning of each
one, as in the C array-of-pointers case, then for N+1 pointers, you
can store N variable-size rows.  Like this:

      _________
     |_|_|_|_|_|    
      | | | | |
      | | | | \_________________________
      | | | \___________________        |
      | | \______________       |       |
      | |               |       |       |
      | |               |       |       |
      V V               V       V       V
      N v a r i a b l e s i z e r o w s

Here, we've stored four strings with no delimiters between them, with
an array of five pointers.  This allows optimally efficient
multidimensional indexing with range-checking.

> (As a digression, if you're really hard up for space, you could
  block the array into 16-string-or-so blocks, store an array of block
  start offsets, and store the 16 string lengths in another array,
  either limiting each individual string to 64KiB or 256 bytes or
  something, or using a variable-length encoding in the other array
  and an array of pointers to every 16th string length.  Then a
  typical block of 16 short strings like the above will cost you about
  64 bytes of string data, 4 bytes of offset into the array, 4 bytes
  of offset into the lengths array, and 16 bytes of string length
  data, for a total of 88 bytes.  That is, assuming that no single
  array is over 4 GiB.)

This ragged-array thing can be multidimensional: you can store a list
of variable-length lists of variable-length strings in the same way,
with the first level of pointers pointing to the beginning of each
string list pointer array, and the pointers in the string list pointer
array pointing to the string starts.  Only three allocations and all
the lengths available at run-time.

Additionally, and importantly for use in array languages that tend to
construct new large arrays by applying operations to existing large
arrays, this multidimensional ragged structure can be constructed
incrementally, one character at a time, without knowing ahead of time
the size of any of the rows.

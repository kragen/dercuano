Suppose I want a cylinder with a given mass and aspect ratio made out
of a material with a given density.  For example, an aspect ratio of
10:1, made of quartz with a density of 2.65 g/cc, and weighing 1kg.

It’s easy to write down and verify the equations that govern this
system:

    diameter = 2 · radius
    area = π · radius²
    volume = area · length
    mass = volume · density
    aspect_ratio = length / diameter

    mass = 1 kg
    aspect_ratio = 10/1
    density = 2.65 g/cc

And it’s not that hard to solve algebraically:

    length / diameter = 10
    length = 10 · diameter = 20 · radius
    volume = π · radius² · 20 · radius = 20 · π · radius³
    volume = mass / density = 1 kg / (2.65 g/cc) ≈ 377 cm³
    377 cm³ ≈ 20 · π · radius³
    6.00 cm³ ≈ radius³
    1.82 cm ≈ radius [excluding the two complex solutions]
    diameter ≈ 3.64 cm
    area ≈ 10.4 cm²
    length ≈ 36.4 cm

Except I got it wrong the first time I did it, coming up with a mass
of 552 grams instead of 1000, because I calculated π 1.82 cm² instead
of π (1.82 cm)², spending about 10 minutes on the problem.  Then when
I tried to apply it to some other cases in a spreadsheet, I
accidentally used 20 instead of 2 · aspect_ratio, getting nonsensical
answers.

The standard approach to reducing the hassle of problems like this is
to solve the equations algebraically to get a procedure to compute
radius, diameter, cross-sectional area, and length given mass, aspect
ratio, and density, or perhaps just volume and aspect ratio:

    radius = ∛(volume / 2 π aspect_ratio)
    diameter = 2 · radius
    length = 20 · radius

Then you can package this procedure up as a subroutine and use it many
times, instead of doing the algebraic manipulation each time.

But it would be nicer to be able to simply specify the relations — or
even refer to them from somewhere — and have the computer find a
solution.

Spreadsheets offer a simple form of this as “Goal seek”.  In Gnumeric
and other similar spreadsheets, you can enter the problem this way,
for example:

           A              B
   1    Radius        5
   2    Area          =pi()*B1^2
   3    Diameter      =2*B1
   4    Aspect ratio  10
   5    Length        =B4*B3
   6    Volume        =B5*B2
   7    Density       2.65
   8    Mass          =B7*B6

And then you can tell “Goal seek” to set B8 to 1000 by changing B1.
However, this isn’t composable (you can’t use a “goal seek” as a
formula in a cell), must be manually recomputed (or recomputed by a
macro) when the inputs change, and can’t be applied across a range
(for example, if you have several different aspect ratios to solve
for).  So it’s a step in the right direction, but it’s awkward to use.
Mac Excel has a somewhat more powerful constrained minimization solver
called “Solver”.

“Goal seek” and “Solver” and similar metaheuristic solvers can often
find solutions to problems that have no closed-form algebraic
solution.

There is a tradition of numerical constraint programming going back to
the 1970s for creating graphics in systems like METAFONT, IDEAL, and
Linogram, typically limited to cases that could be efficiently solved
without recourse to possibly nonterminating algorithms.  For
interactive use, though, such restrictions seem like overkill — and,
in many cases, modern solvers can make short work of problems that
have no closed-form solution.

That is to say, maybe constraint logic programming over infinite
domains would be a handy tool to have for calculations like this.

You could also imagine composing my example model above from existing
submodels.  For example:

    circle:
        diameter = 2 · radius
        area = π · radius²

    prism:
        volume = area · length

    oblong:
        aspect_ratio = length / diameter

    cylinder:
        circle
        prism
        oblong

    uniform_solid:
        mass = volume · density

    cylinder
    uniform_solid
    mass = 1 kg
    aspect_ratio = 10/1
    density = 2.65 g/cc

In this case everything is just all glommed into a single namespace,
like with inheritance, but you could imagine composing it slightly
differently with some hierarchy.  For example, maybe this is a better
model of a cylinder:

    cylinder:
        circle c
        diameter = c.diameter
        prism p
        cross_sectional_area = p.area = c.area
        length = p.length
        oblong
        
Here we are namespacing the circle and prism attributes to
subnamespaces, then explicitly exporting `p.length` and `c.diameter`
to where `oblong` can find them implicitly.

We could imagine a froodier set of models with further properties like
this:

    circle:
        diameter = 2 · radius
        area = π · radius²
        perimeter = π · diameter

    prism:
        volume = end.area · length
        surface_area = 2 · end.area + length · end.perimeter

    cylinder:
        circle c
        prism p
        p.end = c
        oblong

Here, `prism` takes an `end` argument, which has to be something with
an `area` and a `perimeter`, such as `circle`.

This shows how to include properties with values more complex than
simply a number, thus enabling hierarchical decomposition of the
problem (although, lacking conditional recursion, you can compile the
hierarchical structure thus generated into a set of atomic variables
with constraints between them).  You could imagine including
properties whose values are displayed as, for example, images,
sparklines, or 3-D meshes.

I’ve written the above values with units, because that helps me a lot
with interpreting things during debugging and in being assured that
the result is in fact correct.

In terms of type systems, as I said, you could say that `prism` needs
an `end` argument with both `area` and `perimeter`; but actually if
you were to give `prism` a `length` and an `end` argument with just
`area`, it could still compute the `volume`.  And you could imagine
that if you gave it a `surface_area`, `volume`, `length`, and
`end.area`, it could compute `end.perimeter`.  I’m not sure exactly
how to formalize this, but it seems like it could be useful to carry
such deductions out as far as possible.

The electronics shop around the corner from GM Electronics sells
resistors in quantity 10 and up, for AR$8.

is a typical resistor: a 10kΩ ¼W 5% axial through-hole resistor.  Its
price is 10¢ in quantity 1, 4¢ in quantity 10, down to 0.7¢ in
quantity 1000 (US$7 for the 1000).

40¢ is AR$10, so AR$8 is a reasonable price in quantity 10, slightly
cheaper than Digi-Key actually.

I think I should ask for:

    10 1Ω   $8
    10 2.2Ω $8
    10 4.7Ω $8
    10 10Ω  $8
    10 22Ω  $8
    10 47Ω  $8
    10 100Ω $8
    10 220Ω $8
    10 470Ω $8
    10 1kΩ  $8
    10 2.2kΩ $8
    10 4.7kΩ $8
    10 10kΩ  $8
    10 22kΩ  $8
    10 47kΩ  $8
    10 100kΩ $8
    10 220kΩ $8
    10 470kΩ $8
    10 1MΩ   $8
    10 2.2MΩ $8
    10 4.7MΩ $8
    10 10MΩ  $8

That’s 22 separate values, totaling AR$176.

I should probably also include some other basic components: opamps,
microcontrollers, voltage regulators, capacitors, transistors.

Opamps: the most popular opamps on Digi-Key are the TI TSV321RILT
(US$0.58), the TI LM2904DR (US$0.39), and the TI TL072CDR (US$0.62).
I don’t recognize any of those names.  The most popular non-TI opamp
is the ST LMV321ILT (US$0.51), which I assume is a TI LM321 clone.  So
maybe I should ask for an LM321 and expect to pay AR$15 for it.  The
LM741 is the one Electrocomponentes says is standard.

Digi-Key’s most popular μC is STILL a PIC12, a 74¢ one.  But the top
three PIC12s are followed by a $4.34 Cypress CY8C4245AXI-483, whatever
the fuck that is (apparently a Cortex-M0), then an $3.56 STM32 (also a
M0), and then finally a $12.35 ATMega2560.  All the cheapest μCs are
AVRs, though — an ATTiny5 for US$0.17, an ATTiny102 for US$0.30, an
ATTiny10 for US$0.34.  So if I don’t want to hassle with PICs, I
should probably ask for AVRs.  Electrocomponentes does have ATTiny11s,
13s, 2313s, and ATMega32s (which I guess are ATMega328s).  ATtiny13s
cost US$0.40 at Digi-Key.

Voltage regulators: probably I want programmable ones, plus maybe some
7805s.  The top pick among linear regulators is the US$0.72 LM317 with
350k in stock.  Even more popular among switchers is the US$0.70
EZBuck AOZ1280CI from a company I’ve never heard of.  No boost
regulators seem to be super popular.

Capacitors: I should probably get a bunch of 0.1μF ceramic bypass
caps.  These seem to cost about 10¢ apiece in quantity 10 and 5¢
apiece in quantity 100.

For MOSFETs, I should probably get some 2N7000s or similar.  These
seem to cost about US$0.51 in quantity 1 (9.4¢ in quantity 1000), and
they’re good to 60V, 115mA.  Also, for higher power, maybe some
IRF530s (100V) and IRF630s (200V) and their P-channel partners IRF9530
and IRF9630.

For BJTs, the most popular and cheapest are currently apparently
something called an MMBT3904, a 10¢ part good to 40V, 200 mA, with a
PNP counterpart called the MMBT3906 or PMBT3906.  An order of
magnitude faster are the 47¢ Rohm 2SC5662T2LPs, with fT of 3.2 GHz,
good to 11V, 50 mA.  There are also the 12¢ BC846 and BC849, NPN 65V
and 30V 100mA transistors, and their PNP counterparts the BC858 and
BC856, more or less; but these are only good to 100MHz.  The
traditional BJT is I think the 2N3904 (200 mA, 40V) and its PNP
partner the 2N3906.

Oh, I guess I should get some diodes: 1N4007 (the big 1N4001) and
1N4148 at least, and maybe some Schottky 1N5819s.  Maybe 100 of each.
Maybe not from the place that doesn’t guarantee their semiconductors
though.

Connectors for wires are called “borneras”; for pins are “conectores”.

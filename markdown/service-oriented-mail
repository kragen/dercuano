What would a REST or REST-plus-invalidations system for my mail look
like?

You could plausibly argue that this is the wrong question to ask,
because really the right architectural style is something
else — something more like Kafka, which gives you a way to safely
resend operations that may have side effects, and to incrementally
replicate large databases.  But let’s leave that aside for the moment.

At the bottom of the stack, we have three kinds of resources: a mbox
file (which we probably need invalidation notifications, quick ETags,
and byte-range fetches for), some kind of metadata store for tags and
marks, and an index listing all the mboxes.  Everything else is built
on top of that.

The mbox-file resource can be provided by a service that keeps open an
ssh connection and sends commands over it, or several ssh connections,
or with rsync, or local file access, or whatever.  Probably the most
sensible way to do it would be to tunnel REST requests over an ssh
connection to a remote REST service accessing a local file.

The metadata store is probably local and probably can be a simple
key/value store.

A layer up, we convert blocks of the mboxes into resources of their
own.  The interface here is something like

    GET /size?url=foo/bar/baz
    GET /block?url=foo/bar/baz
              &start=180052992
              &bytes=1048576

/size and /block are cacheable stateless microservices that merely
transform ordinary GET requests into GET-with-byte-range and HEAD
requests.

Ideally the mbox blocks would be large enough to be large compared to
the bandwidth-delay product, but small enough to amount to a tolerable
delay when they are fetched.  This is infeasible when my latency is
200+ ms, so I probably have to hide the latency as much as possible
with parallelism and prefetching.  Specifically, my ping time to
canonical.org is currently 175–177 ms, my bandwidth at the office is
about 1.5 megabytes per second, and a tolerable delay is 100 ms, which
means that we want to ensure that 95%+ of our requests can be served
from a local cache, which implies very aggressive cache prefetching.
Or sucking it up, I guess.

The bandwidth-delay product is about 256 kilobytes, coincidentally
almost exactly the bandwidth-delay product of a spinning-rust disk
(though about 64 times that of an SSD being read).  So, with chunks of
256 kilobytes, we could maintain full bandwidth usage with a
parallelism factor of 2; with 128 kilobytes, a parallelism factor of
4; or with 64 kilobytes, a parallelism factor of 8.  Probably the best
overall compromise is a parallelism factor of 8 and 128-kilobyte
chunks.  Then, on the rare occasion that we have to suck up a cache
miss, the size of the 128-kilobyte chunk will add 85 ms of latency on
top of the 175 ms already inherent in the link — not insignificant,
but not the main bottleneck.

My current mailbox is 4.3 gigabytes, which will take about 45 minutes
to initially download at 1.5 megabytes per second.

Given the blocks, we need to find the messages within, and the message
boundaries (`"\nFrom "` or `"\AFrom "`) might cross block boundaries.
For this we use a stateless boundary-parsing service:

    GET /bloxparse?url=/block?url=foo/bar/baz%26start=180052992%26bytes=1048576

This returns three items: an array of (potentially many) byte offsets
where definite message boundaries within the block are found, an array
of byte offsets before the beginning of the block which could
potentially be message boundaries (containing zero or one item; this
is if the block begins with something like "rom "), and an array of
byte offsets just before the end of the block which could potentially
be message boundaries (similarly, containing zero or one item, for
cases where the block ends with "\nF" or something.)

If I run this locally, it should be cached pretty aggressively,
because I have 181490 message boundaries in those 4.3 gigabytes, so a
single 11-byte decimal number or 8-byte binary number stands in for 23
kilobytes of data.  This very minimal summary, which can be generated
in about 10 CPU seconds (with the bsdmainutils from command, for
example), occupies about 2 megabytes and can avoid transferring 4.3
gigabytes.

This /bloxparse service is invoked by an /mboxparse service which
manages some amount of concurrency and reconciles the possible offsets
near the ends of blocks.

(In a more generalized sense, they aren’t so much possible offsets as
sets of candidate finite state machine states: if the finite state
machine is in state 3 or 5 at the beginning of this block, then it has
found a message boundary; at the end of the block it is in state 2.
More generally it is a mapping from input states to output states.
But maybe that level of complexity isn’t needed here, since the
message-boundary-parsing service is very simple.)

The /mboxparse service takes the same parameters and provides the same
result format as /bloxparse, but also takes optional blocksize and
nprocs parameters.

However, it isn’t necessary to parse the whole mailbox in order to
start parsing message headers and contents from it and processing
queries.  We can chain two calls to the /block service to fetch a
message, the second-invoked one fetching a 128k-aligned block and thus
more neatly cacheable, and the other one extracting a message from it
according to /mboxparse.

Somewhere nearby we should have a service that reformats /mboxparse
results into lists of links to messages, and perhaps another that maps
somewhat simple links to messages into redirects to the double-chained
/block resource mentioned above:

    /msg?mbox=foo/bar/baz
        &start=180053082
    redirect to
        /block?url=/block?url=foo/bar/baz
            %26start=180052992
            %26bytes=1048576
        &start=180053082
        &bytes=20330

It would be nice to be able to somehow incrementally list the messages
that have been parsed so far, like with some kind of re-rereadable
message queue, like Kafka.  Lacking such a thing, we can prefetch
stuff in the background, I guess.

Once we have some message URLs, we can start parsing those messages so
we can index them, both with full-text indexing and with traditional
database-column indexing.  Perhaps we maintain cached index segments
corresponding to segments of the mailbox, and cache merge results for
those index segments, re-merging index segments on demand.

A parse request might look like

    GET /parse822?url=foo/bar/baz

where foo/bar/baz is something like the /msg? URL mentioned above.  It
returns some kind of parsed representation of the message headers,
perhaps encoded using FlatBuffers; this parsing can be cached.  (Maybe
/hdr is better?)

A query process might fetch index segments (computed on the fly if
necessary) for ever-larger sections of the mailbox, starting from the
end, running sort-merge joins on them, perhaps ceasing once it has
enough results to fill the screen (or a bit more), and perhaps
maintaining a couple of different query frontiers open at
once — full-text index segments and header index segments, for
example.

The desire to be able to move various kinds of processing to the
storage server suggests that it would be best for the service
identifiers like /parse822 to be mapped not to processes on machines
but to pieces of code, perhaps bundled up with some kind of handle to
a persistent state for the services that aren’t purely stateless.
Then a sort of query optimizer can try running the service locally,
and if that’s taking a long time (e.g. >10ms), try running it remotely
as well and use whichever one gets faster results.  Some kind of
standardized bytecode would be one way to handle such mobile-code
services.  (Also you could hide this behind a process-on-machine
resource.)

All of this somewhat abstracts away the question of bandwidth usage,
treating it as an implementation detail of the services, when it kind
of isn’t really — if I have a bunch of useless local jobs sucking up
all my uplink bandwidth, it’s going to make anything else I try to do
slow.  You could conceivably pass in a handle to an accounting
resource to the service when you invoke it for it to charge its
bandwidth and even CPU usage to, which would have the ability to cut
it off and cause it to fail fast if it went over its resource limits
or if you just no longer cared about the results.

All of this is about reading mail.  Sending mail is a different
matter; we want to ensure that mail gets sent exactly once.  If the
client has a private namespace on the server (/outmail/myhostname) it
can peremptorily allocate message-IDs within there, assuming it hasn’t
suffered an attack of amnesia due to some kind of virtual machine
checkpoint and restart (which could cause it to reuse the same message
ID), and PUT messages there.  As long as PUT is atomic then it’s all
good; retries are safe.  In HTTP, PUT also has an If-None-Match: *
option which can be used to ensure that you never overwrite an
existing message, but what do you do in that case?  (I guess you can
GET the message to see if you previously PUT the same message and
forgot about it, or whether it’s a collision.)  If there’s some kind
of collection indexing, then a mail-sending process on the server can
watch the collection index for changes, passing the mail to Postfix or
whatever when it sees a new message.

That is, Kafka-like topics aren’t necessary for reliable exactly-once
mail sending.  HTTP semantics are more than adequate.

Other useful stateless services:

    /mime?url=foo/bar/baz

Gives you an index of the MIME structure of the RFC-822 message; the
links add more parameters and contain enough data to do the parsing
efficiently.

    /col?parser=/parse822
        &col=subject
        &items=/msglist?foo

Passes the message URLs in /msglist?foo through /parse822?url=$url and
extracts URL-subject pairs (the “subject” “column”) from them.

    /invert?from=bar
        &to=baz
        &data=/col?foo

Invokes /col?foo and inverts it, converting values to keys and keys
(such as message URLs) to values, and sorting by the new key.
Excludes rows whose keys are outside the range from bar to baz.
(Maybe the exclusion should be elsewhere?)

    /union?data=/a
        &data=/b
        &data=/c

Merges some sorted sequences of key-value pairs.  Note that applying
/invert with a range to /union gives you a single-field query over a
merged index.

    /join?data=/a
        &data=/b
        &data=/c

Given some sequences of key-value pairs, this returns one row for each
key that occurs in all the datasets, with the values for each dataset
concatenated.

By applying /join to some /inverts applied to /inverts with ranges
applied to /unions of the appropriate /cols, you can get a multi-field
query.  If you leave out the /inverts, you get a message index.

Ideally every service should be self-describing in that if you invoke
it without all the mandatory parameters, it gives you IDL for how to
call it, an HTML form or equivalent.  Also, we need some way of
assigning media types to URLs and URL input fields to make it easy to
plug things together, and a better invocation syntax with less noisy
parameters, and supporting URL nesting.  Something like Clojure
keyword syntax.

Also, both requests and responses should be able to contain
capabilities, in order to avoid confused-deputy attacks.

An interactive prompt should promiscuously prefetch stuff as you are
composing your request so you can see what you’re doing, since GET is
safe.  If you do some interactive exploration, you should then be able
to go back and factor out some parameters from your script, then turn
it into a new microservice.

Minimal implementation
----------------------

Of course I don’t need all this shit to be able to try it out, and I
do need my mail pretty soon.  A mini HTTP server with a small number
of simple scripts (parse message starts, provide mailbox size and
mailbox blocks) that I can tunnel over ssh should be pretty doable.
I’d need some special-purpose caching logic but nothing really
special.  Also mapping some URLs to ssh-tunneled URLs and others to
local scripts seems like it should be pretty doable.

In terms of data formats, I can probably get by with space-separated
URL-encoded fields with newline record terminators for now.  Or Excel
CSV, which is probably just as easy, but doesn’t sort properly.

Sorting and caching is probably pretty easily done with LevelDB or
maybe Redis.  Or both.  LevelDB on my laptop can handle about 300k
record insertions per second, so about half a second to sort the
subjects of all my messages.  /bin/sort sorts my 100k-line
~/netbook-misc-devel/bible-pg10.txt in 770 ms, or 420 ms with
`LANG=C`, which is the same speed (even with `-S 1G`).  It seems like
it should be possible to go faster since that file is only 4.4
megabytes; `LANG=C wc` takes 100ms.

As another sample computation, `time grep -a '^Subject: '
adjuvant-mbox.1g | wc` finds 43893 subject lines in 1073741824 bytes
(1 GiB) containing 41630 message starts in 11.5 seconds.  Oh wait, it
takes 740ms if it's already in memory, then another 740ms if I pipe it
through sort.  The total time for `grep | sort | wc` drops to 1000ms
with `LANG=C`, which mostly affects sort.

HTTP/2 supports out-of-order responses over a single connection, so
using HTTP/2 would avoid the need to use multiple HTTP connections.
The quasi-required encryption would probably hurt performance, but it
isn’t really required in the standard.

I should check out Hyper the Terminal and see if it has anything
interesting (no, not for this).  And maybe Spark and Samza.

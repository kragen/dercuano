Very fast FIR filtering with time-domain zero stuffing and splines
==================================================================

It just occurred to me that maybe you can use splines to do
convolution with large-support kernels without high-frequency
components much more efficiently than using FFTs or time/space-domain
convolution.

The underlying intuition here is that you can approximate the large
kernel with a uniform spline of, say, second through fourth order, and
then convolve that spline with the original data very efficiently.

This uses a series of inexpensive linear discrete-time time-invariant
processing operations, specifically sparse-kernel convolution and
boxcar filtering (simple moving average).  But it does not fit into
the standard FIR or IIR molds, so perhaps it’s been overlooked so far.
It is potentially an IIR filter, but the usual description of IIR
filters in terms of linear combinations of past input and output terms
does not yield an efficient implementation.

Splines
-------

The spline curve through knots (0, 1) and (n, 0) for all other
integral n approaches sinc as its degree approaches infinity.

Sparse-kernel convolution
-------------------------

A sparse convolution kernel is one that’s zero at almost all points,
except for a finite number of impulses.  That is, the cardinality of
its support is finite, and small compared to the bounds of its
support.  For example, in a discrete time domain, consider the kernel
[-1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1].  It should be apparent that,
although this kernel covers 17 samples, you don’t need 17
multiplications per sample to convolve with it without transforming to
the frequency domain; you only need three.  (And, in this case, even
those happen to be trivial multiplications.)

In general, convolving a discrete-time signal with an N-impulse sparse
kernel in the time domain can be done in N multiply-accumulates per
input sample, regardless of the width of the kernel’s support bounds.

In particular, the sparse kernels we will consider have impulses at
the knots of some uniform spline; since uniform splines have regularly
spaced knots [XXX is that the right definition?], the impulses in our
kernel are also regularly spaced.

Boxcar filtering
----------------

Boxcar filtering is convolution with a “rectangular function”, which
is some arbitrarily scaled and shifted version of the “boxcar
function”, which is 1 from -½ to ½ and zero elsewhere.  This filter is
also known as the “moving average” (or, to avoid ambiguity, “simple
moving average”), “running mean”, “rolling mean”, “box blur”, or “mean
filter”.  This kernel and sinc are Fourier-transform duals.

Boxcar filtering of a discrete-time signal is very efficient: a
boxcar-filtered signal is just the difference between terms a fixed
distance apart in the signal’s prefix sum (aka indefinite sum or
antidifference), although this imposes a constant multiplication on
you that you may wish to undo with a division.  This means that you
can calculate an boxcar filter of arbitrary width with one addition
and one subtraction per sample, plus a big enough intermediate FIFO to
cover the boxcar’s length.

[Repeated convolution of the boxcar function with itself][0] yields
the sequence of cardinal B-splines, which are successive
piecewise-polynomial approximations to a Gaussian.  Any uniform
B-spline can be expressed as a weighted sum of these cardinal
B-splines.

Efficiently approximating a spline-kernel convolution
-----------------------------------------------------

Because you can express any uniform B-spline as a weighted sum of
cardinal B-splines, you can choose a regularly-spaced sparse kernel
that will produce a given uniform compactly-supported degree-M
B-spline through the knots when convolved with a fixed-width boxcar
filter M+1 times.

Since composition of convolutions is not just commutative but also
associative, this means that convolving your original signal with the
N-impulse sparse kernel and then with a boxcar filter M+1 times will
precisely convolve the image with an arbitrary N-knot degree-M uniform
B-spline.  This requires N multiply-accumulates and 2M+2 additions and
subtractions per sample, M+1 FIFOs whose size is each the impulse
spacing.  In floating-point, the initial sparse kernel can be
premultiplied by a small constant to compensate for the undesired
amplification resulting from calculating from computing the boxcar
filters without normalization; in fixed-point, most likely a bit shift
in between stages of box filtering will be needed.

(I think this spline technique generalizes to a nonseparable
multiple-dimensional kernel; if that is so, its computational
advantage in two or three dimensions should be enormously greater.)

This approach is a fully general optimization for linear FIR filters
used as bandpass filters, band-stop filters, and low-pass filters.  It
probably isn’t useful for high-pass filters, because you will
frequencies all the way up to Nyquist in your kernel, which means that
your spline knots are necessarily a single sample apart.

However, because you can ensure that your filter (the one you
implemented, not just the one you were approximating) is linear-phase,
you can subtract the filtered signal from the (lagged to zero-phase or
π-phase) original signal to achieve some limited high-pass filtering.

(Note that in this case, since your sparse kernel is required to be
even, you can use the [folded FIR filter trick][1] to cut the
multiplications required by half again.)

I am SWAGging that this means that you need a number of
multiplications per sample comparable to the Q of your filter if it’s
a bandpass filter, regardless of frequency.  That is, for a Q of 20,
you might need 11, or 21, or 41 multiplications per sample, but I
doubt that you’ll need 128 or that you can get by with 5.  This, in
turn, means that these spline-based filters should be very competitive
with FFT-based techniques for all one-dimensional filtering outside
the design space where Goertzel takes over.

(I thought maybe you could improve the Q further by composing the
filter with itself, but it turns out that doesn’t work: the Q improves
by √2, but the computation time doubles.  You have to actually include
more signal samples under the kernel to efficiently get better Q.)

### Designing the sparse kernel ###

I think you can totally just take a continuous FIR kernel and sample
it at its Nyquist frequency, i.e. multiply it by a comb filter, and
then convolve the result with the sparse kernel of coefficients for
the fundamental spline you’re using.

Spline definitions I’m confused about
-------------------------------------

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline says, “Any spline function of
given degree can be expressed as a linear combination of B-splines of
that degree. Cardinal B-splines have knots that are equidistant from
each other. ... A fundamental theorem states that every spline
function of a given degree, smoothness, and domain partition, can be
uniquely represented as a linear combination of B-splines of that same
degree and smoothness, and over that same partition. ... A cardinal
B-spline has a constant separation, h, between knots. The cardinal
B-splines for a given degree n are just shifted copies of each
other.”

https://www.cs.unc.edu/~dm/UNC/COMP258/Papers/bsplbasic.pdf seems
better.  It says splines are the linear combinations of B-splines.
“‘B-spline’ refers to a certain spline of minimal support and,
contrary to usage unhappily current in CAGD [computer-aided geometric
design], does not refer to a curve which happens to be written in
terms of B-splines.”

Aha, and it explains that cardinal splines are the splines whose knots
are at ℤ.  I thought those were “uniform splines”.

Related work
------------

Unser, Aldroubi, and Eden’s delightful 1993 paper [0] pioneered the
use of the running-sum algorithm for linear-time B-spline filtering.
On p. 827, they explain B-spline filtering:

> We propose the concept of B-spline filtering which is the process of
> applying a filtering operator to the continuous B-spline
> representation of a signal.  When the operator is discrete, this
> procedure is rather trivial and does not seem to have any specific
> advantages: due to the linearity of all operations, one may as well
> apply the filter to the discrete signal and avoid the unnecessary
> transformation step.  Of greater interest is the case where the
> impulse response of the filter itself is represented by a B-spline
> of order *p*.

(By “represented by a B-spline”, they mean “represented by a weighted
sum of B-splines”, as the equation not quoted here clarifies; Unser
et al. regularly use "B-spline" to mean “weighted sum of B-splines”, a
usage which de Boor deplores.)

From this they derive that you can do a discrete convolution of the
B-spline coefficients representing the signal and the filter kernel to
get the (higher-order) B-spline coefficients of the convolution
result.

However, it appears that applying this result to a discrete signal
requires first deriving the B-spline coefficients from the discrete
signal by a discrete convolution with the B-spline coefficients of the
fundamental spline, and then after computing the convolution result in
B-spline form, converting back to discrete-signal form by discrete
convolution with the (higher-order, and thus longer-support!) sampled
B-spline.  This is a substantial amount of computation.  Also, the
Unser et al. algorithm requires the signal and the filter to be
sampled (i.e. have spline knots spaced) at the same sampling rate, so
it is no more efficient for a filter containing only low frequencies.

This restricts the applicability of the 1993 spline filtering
algorithm.

The present work improves over the Unser et al. algorithm by avoiding
the necessity to convert the signal as well as the filter kernel to
and from the spline representation; and, furthermore, for filter
kernels bandlimited to low frequencies, it can approximate the kernel
with a high-order spline with much more widely spaced knots, resulting
in much less computation.

Ferrer-Arnau et al. 2013 [1] developed a filtering algorithm which
superficially sounds very similar to the present one: they improved
Unser et al.’s spline filtering algorithm by an approximate FIR
filter.  Upon further investigation, they developed a particular FIR
filter to approximate the process of fitting a cubic spline to noisy
data, rather than developing a spline to approximate an arbitrary FIR
filter.

Vrcelj and Vaidyanathan 2001 [2] also uses FIR filters to
approximately transform a signal into B-spline coefficients, rather
than using B-spline coefficients to approximate a FIR filter.

CIC filters (Hogenauer 1980) are very similar indeed to the present
work, consisting as they do of a composition of a cascade of
running-sum filters (“integrators”), factored into a cascade of
integrators, decimation, and a cascade of differentiators; or, for
upsampling, a cascade of differentiators, zero-stuffing, and a cascade
of integrators.  Hmm, XXX if you stick a FIR filter in between two CIC
filters running at a lower rate, is it the same thing?  No; the CIC
filter is *much more efficient*.  The recommendation to put your
compensation filter’s cutoff below a ¼ of the first null frequency
probably requires more FIR coefficients than I was thinking were
necessary, but probably also applies to the present work!

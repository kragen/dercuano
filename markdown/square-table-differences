A failed attempt to make squares cheaper to compute
===================================================

Could you cheaply generate a lazily filled square table using the
method of differences?

The squares are the sums of the odd naturals; 5² = 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7
+ 9, for example.  The simplest way to tabulate the sequence of
squares *y* = *x*², or for that matter any polynomial function, is
using the method of differences, here using three columns because the
sequence is quadratic:

    2    1    1
    2    3    4
    2    5    9
    2    7   16
    2    9   25
    2   11   36
    2   13   49

Here each number is the sum of the number to its left and the number
above it, except the first row.

This is not a very appealing way to find 28², though.

Consider, though, if we want to tabulate *y* = (3*x*)² = 9*x*².  We
can tabulate this sequence with the same algorithm, but starting from
a first row that is multiplied by 9:

    18    9    9
    18   27   36
    18   45   81
    18   63  144
    18   81  225
    18   99  324
    18  117  441
    18  135  576
    18  153  729

This has gotten us somewhat more quickly to 27² = 729, which is very
close to knowing 28²; specifically, the difference is 2·27 + 1 = 55,
so 28² = 729 + 55 = 784.  We could have gotten there even faster by
tabulating *y* = (9*x*)² = 81*x*² in the same way, starting with a
first row multiplied by 9² = 81:

    162    81    81
    162   243   324
    162   405   729

That is, this setup allows us to leap ahead as we tabulate squares,
skipping eight out of every nine items.  We could leap by tens, or by
hundreds, or by 27s, or by any other number.  And once these squares
are tabulated, we can keep them tabulated and not recalculate the ones
needed to get us close to our objective.

This suggests a general procedure for finding your way to a given
square with a logarithmic number of N-digit additions: first leap by
the largest power of 3 less than the number, twice if necessary; then
the next-largest power of 3, twice if necessary; and so on, until
you’re leaping by 1s.  So, for example, to square 451, first find the
square of 243, then 324 (leaping by 81), then 405, then 432 (leaping
by 27), then 441 (leaping by 9), then 450, then 451.  This involves 12
three-digit additions, which is worse than the standard
partial-products approach, but only by a factor of 4.  And it’s the
same 12 operations we’d need to find the 451st term of an arbitrary
quadratic sequence, not just *y* = *x*².  And maybe some of those
values would be already tabulated if this isn’t the first number we’re
squaring.

However, there’s a missing piece here.  When we arrived at 27 leaping
by 9s, our computational state said:

    162   405   729

To leap by 1s again instead of 9s, we need to somehow get from that to
this:

      2    55   729

The 2 is easy — it’s the same 2 on the first line of the leaping-by-1s
square sequence — but where do we get the 55 from?

I’m pretty sure that the second column we need to slow down by a
factor of 9 is a linear function of the previous computational state
(162, 405, 729), and I think you can derive that linear function from
Newton’s divided-differences form for the underlying polynomial.

But I suspect it really only depends on the 405 in this case.  55 is
55 because it’s 2*x* + 1.  405 is 405 because it’s 18*x* - 81.  So 55
is 2(405 + 81)/18 + 1 = 405/9 + 10.  Extending this to arbitrary
quadratic functions (which potentially have a different second-order
difference) might involve taking the 162 into account: it’s the 2 of
our original second-order difference multiplied by the square of our
speed.

This is kind of shitty, though, because we were hoping to avoid
multiplying a two-digit number by itself, and to get there we ended up
dividing a three-digit number by 9, which is *harder*.

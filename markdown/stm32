I think I am switching from AVRs to STM32s for seven principal reasons.

1. Speed: STM32s are much faster, from almost twice the clock speed to
   over ten times the clock speed, with registers that are four times
   as wide, including a single-cycle 32×32→32 multiply — which would
   be 10 8-bit multiplies and 7 8-bit adds.  And AVRs without an
   external crystal are limited to 8 MHz, while STM32s can run at full
   speed on their internal ±1% RC oscillators.
2. Power: With an STM32, you can run 32 32-bit instructions on the
   energy the AVR needs to run a single 8-bit instruction.  AVRs,
   despite their “picoPower” marketing, use about 7500 picojoules per
   instruction (pJ/insn), and those are 8-bit instructions.  The
   STM32F0 uses about 1500 pJ/insn, and the STM32L0 uses about
   230 pJ/insn.
3. Cost: The STM32 costs more than the AVR, but only slightly, and
   less per pin or per MIPS.  The 48MHz STM32F031x4, with 39 GPIOs,
   costs US$1.30 in quantity 1 on Digi-Key.  The cheapest reasonable†
   AVR is the 20MHz ATtiny13A, which costs US$0.40 and has 6 GPIOs.
4. Size: The STM32L is *tiny*, 2.133 mm × 2.070 mm in the WLCSP
   package, with 21 GPIOs (two of which you can run I²C on).  The AVR
   ATtiny4/5/9/10 is physically the same size, but only has 8 total
   pins and 4 GPIOs.
5. Scalability: STM32s have a much higher ceiling; AVRs top out at
   20 MHz with a limited range of peripherals, while STM32F7s run at
   216MHz and have all kinds of crazy things.
6. ADC: STM32s’ ADCs are 12-bit and run at 1Msps and up, while AVRs’
   ADCs are 10-bit and run up to 15ksps at maximum resolution.
7. Debugging: AVRs’ DebugWIRE protocol, in a big FUCK YOU to users of
   free software, is undocumented, while STM32s have a debugging
   interface called “serial wire debug” which is supported in OpenOCD.

† The ATtiny4/5/9/10 are cheaper at 17¢ but are almost useless.

Introduction
------------

I think the STM32F031 is going to be my new favorite microcontroller,
replacing the AVR.  It’s a 32-bit 48MHz Cortex-M0, it costs US$1.30 in
quantity 1 on Digi-Key, and there is already Arduino support for it,
which should make it easy to get started.  Like the ATMega328, it has
32 (or 16) kilobytes of Flash and 4 kilobytes of SRAM.  And, in
addition to easier-to-handle sizes with shitloads of pins (up to 39
GPIOs!), it comes in a 2.4-mm-square WLCSP25 form factor.  And it uses
one fifth the power of the AVR at the same clock speed!

(Hmm, the above mostly refers to the STM32F031x4/6, but I might have
gotten some details from the STM32F030x4/6/8/C mixed in there.  The
4/6 is 16 or 32K; 8 and C are 64 and 256 K, and more interestingly, up
to 32K of SRAM.  These larger chips also come with up to 55 GPIOs.
There are also STM32F3 and STM32F4 families, which are progressively
more awesome; the F4 runs at 168MHz and has three 5Msps DACs, and both
have floating-point.)

On the bad side, it still doesn’t have a radio (unlike the ESP32) and
it only runs up to 3.6 volts — 5 volts is right out.

[There’s an overview by Satoshi NM][1].

Instruction set
---------------

ARMv6-M with Thumb-2, ONLY.  RAWK.  Nothing comes close for machine
code density.  And it has a 1-cycle 32×32 → 32 (☹) multiply, which is
pretty astounding even if it does discard half the result.

The STM32F0xxx Cortex-M0 Programming Manual (PM0215) doesn’t include
instruction timings at all except to say that the multiplier takes a
single cycle, actually.

There’s a separate stack pointer for interrupt handlers if you enable
it, so that the interrupt handlers (I think there can be up to 7 on
the stack at once) don’t eat into the worst-case stack space of every
thread.

Software support
----------------

OpenOCD even supports the “serial wire debug” interface, which
apparently allows you to turn the microcontroller into the puppet of
your workstation using two pins.

GPIOs and 5V
------------

It does have 5V-*tolerant* I/O pins, though not all of them.  Also,
its GPIOs *can* be configured as open-drain rather than push-pull,
which has two huge benefits:

- They can communicate with 5-V systems if there’s an external 5V
  pullup;
- Perhaps they can switch somewhat heftier loads?

Supposedly the pins can source or sink 20 mA each, and up to 80 mA
over the whole chip, which I think is inferior to the AVR’s 200;
still, if I could hook a 12V 100mA motor directly to four open-drain
GPIO pins, that would be pretty awesome.  I don’t think I can because
they get configured as input pins during and after reset, and those
aren’t supposed to be subjected to more than 4 volts.

Some other STM32s have a special pin for sinking a lot of current from
an infrared LED.

The GPIO pins can also be configured with internal pullups, pulldowns,
or neither.

Hmm, wait, it says the 5V-tolerant pins can be subjected to V_{DDIOx}
+ 4.0 volts as long as the pullups and pulldowns are disabled.  What’s
V_{DDIOx}?  Oh, I guess that’s the 2.0V to 3.6V Vdd.  So 7.6V is
reasonable.  But anything over 5.5V is outside “general operating
conditions”.

The smallest and cheapest ones only have 15 GPIOs, which is still
pretty decent; that’s under 9¢ per GPIO!

The massive number of GPIOs can toggle at up to half the clock speed,
i.e. 24MHz, supposedly.  I don’t quite understand how this works; do
you just run a sequence of instructions that loads immediate 16-bit
values into some CPU register and then writes them to the
memory-mapped I/O register `GPIOx_ODR`, I guess?  Or is there some way
to feed the GPIOs with the DMA controller?

Analog
------

Its ADC is 12-bit rather than the AVR’s 10-bit,
and it’s supposedly 1μs!  Does
that really mean 1Msps?  It apparently does... and it has 9 or 10
external input channels.  And it supports DMA, and there’s a “DMA
circular mode” (`DMACFG`=1) to just dump stuff into a ring
buffer — ideal for seeing pre-trigger data!

It doesn’t seem to have an analog comparator input, unfortunately.
You have to fake it by configuring the ADC to do conversions
constantly and fire an interrupt when they hit a threshold.

Another drawback compared to the AVR is that the ADC’s full-scale
reading is always Vdda, which must be at least as high as the power
supply — at least 2.4 V.  It has a calibrated internal bandgap voltage
reference to measure against, but it can’t set that as the ADC
reference voltage directly.  This means that the 4096 counts in the
output are spaced at least 580 μV apart, and 880 μV at 3.6 V, while
the AVR’s 1024 counts can be spaced 1.07 mV apart.  Some other STM32
chips support a separate VREF+ (alluded to in ST AN2834), but the
STM32F031x4/6 does not.  Only STM32s with 100 or 144 pins do.  ST
suggests solving the problem with a preamplifier.

The ADC requires at least 2.4 V, although most of the rest of the chip
will run down to 2.0 V.  And it uses 1 mA at its normal speed.

It’s possible to configure the ADC for lower bit depth (10, 8, or 6
bits) to speed it up (to 928, 785, or 643 ns, respectively), which
suggests you could crudely digitize signals up to 780 kHz with one
STM32.  The sample-and-hold is 1.5 cycles of the 14MHz ADC clock, so
about 107 ns.  This seems like it is likely to sharply attenuate
frequency components above about 10MHz even if you can get several
chips sampling them at once.

The Vdda pin is supposed to draw only about 0.9 mA, so putting it on a
separate regulator might improve precision.

Like the AVR, it has an inaccurate temperature sensor: ±5°, better
than the ±10° on the AVR.  (Hmm, at least on the STM32L, the Vsense
linearity with temperature is at worst ±2°, and at least 1.48 mV/°,
which you would think would give you 1° accuracy?  Maybe it's just
`TS_CAL2` that is ±5°?)

In terms of PWM, well, it has 9 timers and 11 (?) PWM channels, which
can run off 16-bit timers instead of an 8-bit one, which should give a
lot more dynamic range.  It even has a 32-bit timer!

Some of the timer counters can be run off an external quadrature input
instead, which should enable quadrature feedback up to fairly high
pulse rates.

The PWM counters have an adjustable “auto-reload value” and can count
in either sawtooth, inverted sawtooth, or triangle form.  I think you
can run them off a 48 MHz clock, which ought to enable you to generate
phase-correct PWM waves at 24 MHz and factors thereof (24 MHz, 12 MHz,
8 MHz, 6 MHz, 4800 kHz, 4 MHz, 3428 kHz, etc.)  Or maybe 12 MHz.

They also have a dead-time mode specifically designed for H-bridges.

Buses
-----

It has I²C (including wakeup from Sleep, 10-bit addressing, multiple
7-bit slave addresses, and 1 Mbps “Fast Mode Plus”) and an 18Mbps SPI
interface.  These, like the ADC, support DMA, so you don’t have to
handle interrupts after every byte like on the Arduino.

Its USART, which also supports DMA, can run at up to 6Mbps, which
could be handy for RS-485.

The DMA support means that the CPU can sometimes be delayed in its
access to memory, which seems like it could cause some problems for
cycle-accurate bitbanging.  The CPU doesn’t seem to have a cache (why
would you have a cache when all your RAM is zero-wait-state?), but it
does have a 12-byte instruction prefetch buffer, which could also
cause unpredictable timing; it can be disabled with `FLASH_ACR`.

The larger STM32F030x4/6/8/C has two I²C interfaces instead of one and
two SPI interfaces instead of one.  Other STM32 chips have a wide
variety of peripherals available.

Clocks
------

In addition to an external crystal, in theory, like the AVR, it has an
8MHz internal oscillator — with an optional 6× PLL to bring it up to
48MHz.

A neat thing is that if the external crystal fails, it automatically
switches to its internal oscillator.  (But then it fires an NMI, and
your ISR needs to clear the CSSC bit in `RCC_CIR` to escape the NMI
loop, so it’s not totally transparent.)

Power
-----

Supposedly it normally uses like 20mA at 3.6 V and 48 MHz or more like
12mA if all the peripherals are turned off.  This works out to
something like 1.5 nJ per 32-bit instruction if we figure on 1
instruction per cycle.  Strangely, the datasheet doesn’t supply
current consumption figures at 2 V.

This scales linearly down to about 3 mA at 8 MHz, then down to about
1mA as frequency approaches zero.

It has four modes: Run, Sleep, Stop (3.2–55 μA), and Standby
(0.7–3 μA), which last is sort of turned off actually, losing all the
memory contents.  It can run down to 2V.  Stop mode still has a bunch
of possible interrupt sources as wake sources, though I’m not sure if
timers are among them.  (I think its RTC may be capable of doing
this.)  Presumably getting out of Standby involves rebooting, and it
says the RTC can do this.  Also the watchdog timer can wake it from
Stop or even Standby.

The RTC has a separate supply and consumes 0.5–2.1 μA when enabled.
It can continue working down to 1.65 V.

Wakeup from Stop mode takes 2.8 to 9 μs; wakeup from Standby takes
like 50 or 60.

All of this would seem to imply that it is sensible to use Stop mode
for duty cycles down to about 0.1% as long as the wakeups are for at
least, say, 20 μs of execution — 1000 instructions or so.  Which means
that you can reasonably wake up every 25 ms for 1000 instructions,
using about 2 μJ while awake and another 1 μJ while asleep, for a
total of 120 microwatts, 600 times lower than full power consumption
of 72 mW.

72 milliwatts is about three red indicator LEDs.

(I’m not yet sure how clock speed depends on supply voltage.)

Standby mode might use 5 microwatts, and so makes sense for duty
cycles down to 0.007%, but requires 100 μs or so (5000 instructions)
of execution.  I mean, you could do less execution, but then you would
be spending way more energy on rebooting than on actually getting
anything done.  At this level you’re waking up no more often than
every 1.4 seconds or so.  In this mode nearly all the GPIOs are
tristated.

I think there may be some wrinkles around stabilization time of the
system clock PLL I may be missing here.  Like, if the PLL is disabled,
you only get 8 MHz, not 48.  But if the PLL is enabled, it might take
a while to get sync (up to 200 μs, according to the datasheet).  And
the PLL automatically gets disabled whenever you enter Stop or
Standby, though not Sleep, so you always wake up at 8MHz.

Note that erasing the Flash takes 20–40 MILLIseconds, during which
time presumably the thing is using as much power as normally, or even
more.

A 3-gram Energizer CR2032 lithium coin cell could power the STM32
directly, and its 240mAh down to 2 volts works out to 2.2 kJ.  This
would power the STM32 at full speed for 8 hours (if it can deliver a
reasonable amount of current; its internal resistance is 20Ω until near
the end, which in theory means it can deliver 150mA), in Stop mode 99.9% of
the time waking up 40 times a second for 6 months, or in Standby mode
waking up every 1.4 seconds for 14 years.  (In either case you can use
the IWDG independent watchdog or the RTC real-time clock to wake up at
a scheduled time.)

To power the STM32 at full speed for a full second directly from a
capacitor would require a 16000 microfarad capacitor.  A 1-farad
supercapacitor could theoretically run it for a full minute.  If you
had a buck converter and a boost converter, you could use a
higher-voltage electrolytic.  For example, the last inkjet printer I
took apart has a 100μF 50V electrolytic on its main board, which is a
bit smaller than my last pinky joint; this works out to ⅛J, or 1.74
seconds at full power.

The larger STM32F030 uses about 10% more power at the same high speeds.

1.5 nJ/insn is slightly higher than the 0.9 nJ/insn of the MSP430
family, but much higher than the 0.3 of an LPC1110 (see file
`keyboard-powered-computers`).  Atmel has a line of “picopower” ARM
microcontrollers that are around 0.25 nJ/insn (see file
`low-power-micros`).  Much-lower-power microcontrollers exist but are
not widely used (see `keyboard-powered-computers` and
`low-power-micros`.)

However, the most relevant comparison is the ATmega328, which (despite
sharing the “picopower” moniker) gobbles 7.5 nJ/insn (see
`low-power-micros`).  So the STM32 family uses one fifth the power to
process four times as many bits!

Relevant comparisons include: that an E-ink display uses about 3 mW
during continuous reading at a comfortable rate; the ADC also uses 3
mW while running; and 3 mW from a 12%-efficient solar cell is about ¼
of a square centimeter.

Memory
------

It has a bootloader that can reprogram its own flash.  Also it can
somehow boot from its own SRAM.  Erasing a 1KB page of the flash takes
20–40 ms, and programming a halfword takes 40–60 μs, which is like two
or three thousand clock cycles.

Of course ARM is not Harvard, and so not only is C programming
somewhat simplified, but also, it’s possible to execute code from
SRAM.  In fact, that’s mandatory if you want to keep executing code
while erasing or even writing to the Flash, and the SRAM is
zero-wait-state.

You don’t get the full benefit of the implicit AND operation provided
by NOR flash — the micro tries to protect you from yourself by
refusing to program non-erased locations — except that you *can*
overwrite arbitrary halfwords of the flash with 0x0000 without erasing
entire pages.  I feel like this could be useful.

Board support
-------------

The popular [Blue Pill STMDuino is a Chinese design built around a
STM32F103C8][0], which is a somewhat higher-end STM32: 72 MHz, 64 or
usually 128 KB of Flash, and 20 KB of RAM.  This is a Cortex-M3 rather
than M0.  (M4 is the one with the FPU, saturating arithmetic, and
MAC.).  I think it’s the same size as an Arduino Micro or Nano, I’m
not sure.  It’s 53.0 mm × 22.5 mm, just slightly larger than an
Adafruit Feather.

[0]: http://wiki.stm32duino.com/index.php?title=Blue_Pill

The WLCSP25
-----------

The 2.4mm-square WLCSP25 that the STM32F031x4/6 can come in is
particularly appealing to me.  It’s just so incredibly tiny; it’s only
2.458 mm × 2.36 mm × 585 μm at most, and that includes its balls.  It
should weigh under 10 mg, since it occupies 3.4 μl.  However, a few
sacrifices are made to get it down to 25 pins, or rather solder balls.
Port A has pins 0-10, 13, and 14, but is missing pins 11, 12, and 15.
Port B has pins 0-1, 5-7, and that’s it; port F has just pins 0 and 1,
which are for the external oscillator.  These 20 GPIOs, plus Vdd, Vss,
Vdda, BOOT0, and NRST, suck up all the pins.

Port A and PB1 have the analog input channels, so it’s fully supplied
there.  Port A also has the USART, the SPI interface, and the I²C
interface, and most of these have alternate pins among those included
from port B.  PA13 and 14 have the SWD debugging interface.

It’s missing the battery-backup pin for the real-time clock, it’s
missing the connections for a 32.768kHz watch crystal, and 8 of the
pins aren’t 5V-tolerant (namely, PA0-7), but it doesn’t actually seem
to be missing anything essential except moar GPIOs.

So, if you want to max out your GPIOs, you have 20 GPIOs, or if you
want to preserve debuggability, you have 18 GPIOs and two SWD pins
(PA13 and PA14).  If you want to use it as a debuggable I²C slave to
twiddle and maybe process GPIOs, you additionally dedicate either
PA9-10 or PB6-7 to I²C, and you have 16 GPIOs.  If you need high
timing precision, you put a crystal on PF0-1.  If you want SPI, you
can have it (at 3V) on PA4-7, sacrificing three or four analog pins.
And you have PWM outputs on all the GPIO pins except PF0-1 (the
oscillator pins) and PA13-14 (the SWD pins), except that I think a
couple of those pins are actually just used as triggers for the PWM
waveform (PA0 and PA5 are TIM1_CH1_ETR and TIM2_CH1_ETR, which I don’t
understand.)

Holy *SHIT*, the STM32L
-----------------------

I didn’t realize this at first, but since 2015, there’s *another* line
in the STM32 lineup called the “access line ultra-low-power” STM32L,
the low-power processors.  And these are even *smaller* and also
lower-power.  And their ADC is *even faster* at 1.14 Msps, with DMA.
*And* they have two analog comparators instead of zero.  They still
have SWD, I²C, and SPI (“only” 16Mbps, and then only above 2.7V; at
1.71V it can manage 12Mbps, and at 1.65V 8Mbps).  They’re a bit
slower, though, at 32MHz, but they’re still Cortex-M0+ with a
single-cycle 32×32→32 multiplier.

The STM32L011x3/4 goes for US$1.50 on Digi-Key, and it has a WLCSP25
package (STM32L011ExY) that is 2.133 mm × 2.070 mm.  Miraculously, it
has *more* GPIOs than the larger STM32F0’s WLCSP25: sort of 21 rather
than 20, because the BOOT0 pin can be configured as PB9, though input
only.  It has less memory (the 3 has 8K of Flash, the 4 has 16K, both
have 2K of SRAM) and it can operate down to 1.65 V, or 1.8 V if the
brownout reset circuit is enabled.

The WLCSP25 pinout is gratuitously different from the STM32F031x4/6
WLCSP25 pinout, but since it’s a different physical size, you couldn’t
use it in the same circuit board layout anyway.  Almost the same set
of pins is mapped: pins 0-10, 13, and 14 on port A, pins 0-1, 5-7, and
9 on port B, and pins 14 and 15 on port C, rather than 0 and 1 on port
F, but those are still the external oscillator pins.

The friendliest way to get started with the STM32L might be using the
LQFP32 package, which is 7 mm square and should be easy to
hand-solder, since its pins are every 0.8 mm.

The GPIO currents are a bit lower: 16 mA sunk by three-volt pins,
22 mA sunk by five-volt pins, and 16 mA sourced by either.

### STM32L ADC ###

The 12-bit ADC not only runs at 1.14 Msps down to 1.65V, it only uses
25μA at 10ksps and 200μA at 1Msps, and it supports up to 256× hardware
oversampling in order to fake up to 16-bit sampling.  So you could get
16-bit samples at 4.4 ksps.

### STM32L power ###

The front page of the datasheet claims 0.95 DMIPS/MHz and “down to” 76
μA/MHz in Run mode.  At 1.8V, if we ignore the “down to” clause, this
would work out to 0.144 nJ/insn, 144 pJ/insn, dramatically lower than
the STM32F0; even at its max of 3.6V it’s only twice that,
290 pJ/insn.  The aforementioned 3-gram Energizer CR2032 lithium coin
cell with its 240mAh down to 2 volts (2.2 kJ) could thus power it for
3200 MHz-hours — 100 hours at 32 MHz, 200 hours (8 days) at 16 MHz,
400 hours (17 days) at 8 MHz, 3200 hours (4 months) at 1 MHz.

Perhaps more interesting still, given a 1-farad 2.7-volt
supercapacitor, which has 2 J and 0.9 coulombs down to 1.8 V, it could
run for over 3 MHz-hours; with a 90%-efficient buck-boost regulator
running the supercap down to 1.3 V (2.8 J), it could run 18 billion
instructions, 4.9 MHz-hours.  Such a capacitor as the 104μℓ 4Ω 1F
Nichicon JUWT1105MCD (see file `capacitors`) has a time constant of 4
seconds, so it can mostly recharge within 4 seconds and 95% charge
within 12 seconds.

Digging in a bit more, above 16 MHz it needs at least 1.71 V, and
there are two other “power consumption ranges” up to 16 MHz and
4.2 MHz, which apparently affect the number of wait states (perhaps to
Flash only?).  Power consumption is about 1 mA in sleep mode at 16 MHz
with all peripherals off, and there are seven different low-power
modes.  In Standby mode, it consumes 180 nA without the RTC enabled or
410 nA with the RTC.  It has a “low-power run” mode which can run at
32, 65, or 131 kHz, which, at 25°, runs at 5.7–17μA from RAM or
18–32μA from Flash, which works out to 210 pJ (1.65 V, 131 kHz, RAM)
to 400 pJ (3.6 V, 32 kHz, Flash) per instruction; typical consumption
for normal run mode ranges from 320 μA (4 MHz, running while(1) from
RAM or with prefetch off) to 5.4 mA (32 MHz Dhrystone from Flash).
Likely the most efficient is 1.95 mA for 16 MHz from RAM, which is
further explained as “HSI16 clock source (16 MHz), Range 2, VOS[1:0] =
10, Vcore = 1.5 V, Flash switched OFF”.  If we figure that this is
15.2 MIPS and is being powered at 1.8 V, then that’s 3.5 mW,
230 pJ/insn.

So I can’t figure out where they get the “76 μA/MHz” claim from,
because the best I can find in their measurements is 122 μA/MHz.  Oh,
wait, I think I see how to get partway there — the 1.95 mA is “code
with data processing”, which I think is Dhrystone, and `while(1)` uses
about 30% less power.  That gets you to 85 μA/MHz but not to 76.

This is still enormously better than, say, the 900pJ MSP430F2001.

A tricky bit here is what kind of suspend mode you can get away with
using when there isn’t stuff to do.  You have Sleep (1 mA at 16 MHz),
Stop (with or without RTC, retaining RAM contents), and Standby (with
or without RTC, losing RAM contents).  Aside from the wakeup time, the
problem is that in Standby you can only be woken by the brown-out
reset, power-on reset, RTC “tamper”, something completely undocumented
called “Auto WakeUp (AWU)”, the independent watchdog, and two of the
GPIO pins.  By contrast, in Stop mode, you can also be woken up by the
programmable voltage detector (PVD), the analog comparators, the
LPTIM, all the GPIOs, the RTC (if it’s running), the USART, the
low-power UART, and I²C, though not SPI.  And it only takes 5 μs to
wake up instead of 65 μs.

In exchange for the wakeup limitations, you cut your power; at 1.8 V:

    | mode             |   μA |    μW | time to drain | time to drain  |    duty |
    |                  |      | 1.8 V | CR2032 2.2 kJ | 1F 2.8J        |   cycle |
    |                  |      |       | coin cell     | supercapacitor |         |
    |------------------+------+-------+---------------+----------------+---------|

The “duty cycle” column is the duty cycle at which the power used in
low-power mode equals the power used in run mode at 16MHz.  At greater
than this duty cycle, the majority of power used is in run mode, so
the low-power mode’s power consumption is in the minority; at less
than this duty cycle, run mode’s power consumption is in the minority.

This makes me think that as long as your duty cycle is above 3% or so,
you should just use low-power run mode instead of suspending, and
above 0.1% or so, it isn’t worth worrying about the differences
between the different suspend modes, so you should just use stop with
RTC; but below 0.03% or so, the differences between them could
potentially give you a factor of three improvement in lifetime.

The Sleep mode doesn’t give a huge improvement on power, but it’s very
cheap and only takes 7–10 clock cycles to wake up from.

The wakeup latency means that, above a certain frequency of wakeups,
you no longer get the benefit of a low duty cycle.  At the 5 μs wakeup
time for Stop, for example, you get to the 0.028% duty cycle at 56 Hz,
even if all you do after the wakeup is just go right back to Stop.

(The wakeup time even from Stop actually depends on the clock speed
and the voltage regulator configuration and can range from 5.1 μs to
260 μs (!), and Standby wakeup can range from 65 μs to 3000 μs.)

Such a small device will probably have appreciable power usage in its
communications with other devices.  In “Range 2”, the I²C interface
uses 8.2 μA/MHz, GPIOA uses 6.3 μA/MHz, and GPIOB uses 4.1 μA/MHz.  If
all three are turned on, they total 18.6 μA/MHz, or 300 μA at 16 MHz,
adding about 15% to run-mode power consumption, but increasing
stop-mode power consumption by a factor of over 600.  But maybe you
could enable just I²C while stopped.

If it’s communicating, though, in addition to running its own GPIO
port, it needs to drive the input impedances of the other chip and the
lines in between.  Different input pins have different specified input
leakage currents: ±50 nA, 200 nA, 500 nA, and they’re specified as
having a typical input capacitance of 5 pF, which means that charging
them up to 1.8 V will cost you 9.0 picocoulombs, the same as you spend
on the leakage current in 180 μs, 45 μs, or 18 μs, according to which
leakage current you figure with.

9.0 picocoulombs on half the bits you transmit (the ones that differ
from the previous bit) at 1.8 V gives you a cost of 8.1 pJ per bit,
which triples to 24 pJ for separately-clocked serial protocols like
I²C and SPI.

8 or 24 pJ per bit is relatively significant compared to 230 pJ/insn,
since instructions generally produce 32 bits, which means 7.2 pJ per
output bit.  But it’s far from the overwhelming cost I was fearing.

Local availability
------------------

I can get an STM32F103C8T6 here in Buenos Aires for AR$154 (US$5.39)
or some kind of STM32F030 from /*while1*/ in Liniers for AR$99
(US$3.46).  Arduinos based on the STM32F103C8T6 are even more common
and cost from AR$200 to AR$300 (US$7–10.50).  Large volumes would
therefore seem to depend on importation.

The 103 has a Cortex-M3, USB, 72MHz, CAN, two 1Msps 12-bit ADCs, 20K
of SRAM, 64K of Flash, three 16-bit timers, two I²C interfaces, JTAG,
and 1.25 DMIPS/MHz.  It runs down to 2.0V.  It seems to come in
LQFP100, LQFP64, and LQFP48 packages.  The “C” in the part number
means these are 48 pins, which means 37 GPIOs.

In particular [“Arduino Arm Stm32 Cortex-m3 Stm32f103c8t6

Fun projects
------------

You should totally be able to bitbang NTSC or PAL color from this bad
mofo, or for that matter AM radio.  You should even be able to do AM
radio with their PWM outputs, since that’s the 540 kHz to 1610 kHz
range.  The PWM waves unfortunately have relatively few power levels
available, but the slightly lower frequencies actually within the AM
radio spectrum have more; 545.5 kHz is subharmonic 44, so you should
have 22 meaningfully different power levels available.

Given the 24MHz max GPIO toggle rate, a TV typewriter could in theory
manage 400 kilopixels per 60Hz NTSC field, or 800 kilopixels on the
screen.  But NTSC is actually limited to about 6MHz of bandwidth, so
it’s more like 100 kilopixels per field or 200 kilopixels per
frame — about 400 × 500.  This is enough for 60 lines of 80 columns.

Rebraining a calculator with one of these bastards should give you
access to virtually unlimited computational power.

The 8MHz HSI RC oscillator has an 8-bit HSITRIM register which adjusts
its frequency up or down in steps of about 40kHz, about 0.5%.  If
scaled up into the FM radio range, these are steps of about
0.5 MHz — too big to get usable FM radio out of.  But maybe there’s
another way to bend the HSI frequency by adjusting the voltage,
current, or temperature of the chip.  You’re lacking about a factor of
4 in speed to do direct digital synthesis of FM radio waveforms
without an analog front end, but maybe you could generate, say, a
14 MHz square wave and filter out its 7th harmonic.  This would be
about 3.4 CPU clock cycles per full oscillation, so it would be kind
of tricky, but maybe you could do it.

All the trimming and calibration and precision in the ADC and clocks,
plus the various push-pull/open-drain/pullup/pulldown optionson the
GPIOs, should enable a much better version of the M328, especially if
you use a crystal.  And 3.6V or 2.4V should be a lot safer for the DUT
than 5V.  (Does the M328 run at 5V?)

The AVR could only sample from its ADC at very low sampling rates.
Even the cheapest STM32 can do 1 Msps
and so you should be able to digitize 500 kHz
waveforms.  This gives you about 2.5% of a decent oscilloscope, which
ought to be enough to debug slow circuits.

If you could gang up several STM32s, you could perhaps make 35% of a
decent oscilloscope, or even a bit more.  14 STM32s adequate to the
job should cost under US$10.

Alternatively, it ought to be feasible to build an SDR for broadcast
AM or FM radio using that megasample of capture bandwidth.

Audio communication and touch detection should be easy.

The Magic Kazoo should definitely be built around one of these bad
boys.  So should lots of other musical instruments.

The 25-to-55-kΩ pullups and pulldowns should source or sink a few
hundred μA.  In theory you could use this to very dimly light an LED,
or charge a capacitor or reverse-biased diode by a very small amount
to measure light, heat, radioactivity, or vibration.  Into 10 pF of
capacitance you should get a few tens of mV/ns (MV/s), or a bit under
a volt per 48 MHz cycle.  According to the datasheet, a Vishay 1N4001
is about 15 pF and has a reverse leakage current that rises
exponentially with temperature, from 0.2 μA at 50V at 25° up to 5 μA
at 100° and 180 μA at 150°.  Fortunately or unfortunately, it’s also
near exponential with voltage, being something like 0.03, 1.5, and
20 μA respectively at the 7% of peak reverse that 3.6 V represents.
Unfortunately the input leakage current is given as up to ±0.2 μA in
analog mode, which would overwhelm the smaller numbers in this
list. 1.5 μA at 15 pF is 100 kV/s or 100 mV per 1μs ADC sample time.
(The STM32 pins themselves weigh in at 5 pF.)  A lower-voltage diode
might be a better choice as a temperature sensor.

You should be able to use the hi-Z input state for detecting
electrical fields, given this 0.2 μA number.  Maybe a capacitive
divider would be useful. 

It should be feasible to do a pretty fast 16-bit-wide logic analyzer
using one of the 16-bit GPIO ports.  I don’t know how often you can
read them but it seems like it should be at least 10 million times a
second, producing 20 megabytes per second.  Probably you could stream
such data out to an SPI peripheral at the much slower 18 megabits per
second the SPI interface supports.

For parallel computing, it should be feasible to implement the PAPERS
Beowulf barrier synchronization primitive on a cluster of these guys
using their open-drain/pullup configuration.  As each microcontroller
reaches the barrier, it writes a 1 to its pin, but continues to read a
0 from it until the last open-drain output on the bus gets set to 1.
Given the 20 mA sink current capability and the 25 kilohm minimal
pullup resistance, it should be possible to synchronize over 100
microcontrollers within microseconds this way.  If only a small number
of microcontrollers enable their pullups, it should be feasible to
scale to thousands.  This approach is actually used in the Gestalt
FABNET bus.

It should also be possible to compute a crude majority rule function
in this way, by using the pullups and pulldowns to “vote”.

Parallel computing is especially appealing given the STM32L0’s six
times lower cost per instruction, with the limitation to 16MHz.  You
could plausibly build a 3×3×3×3 81-processor hypercube with 162
kilobytes of RAM and 1.30 megabytes of Flash, capable of 1.2 billion
instructions per second, that weighed 100 milligrams and ran (for
embarrassingly parallel problems) on 1.8 V, 160 mA, 280 mW, for a BOM
cost of under US$100.  It might measure 7 mm × 7 mm × 7 mm if the
circuit boards and capacitors don’t take up too much space.  Without
any external switches, it could scale its power usage down to 26
microwatts by moving all the processors to Standby; with one, it could
power the unused processors off entirely, leaving a power of 0.32 μW
for the one left in Standby.

It should be straightforward to do the DSP necessary for short-range
ultrasonic communication even at hundreds of kHz, if you can find
adequate transducers.

I think the key to inventing ubiquitous computation, if found in a
literary genre, is going to be fantasy, not science fiction.  Sterile
tropes of human-like computers with voice interfaces do not help us to
imagine how we might actually interact with these devices.  If we can
give the objects in our environment new rules — whatever new rules we
want — what rules would we like to give them?  If you can enchant the
objects in your environment to act however you want, what would you
have them do?

Perhaps you would have your possessions follow you around, put
themselves away when you got home, and scream or fight back when they
were being stolen.  Your bullets and arrows would never miss, and your
clothes would become hard as rock when the bullets of others were
about to hit them.  Your utensils would change color or cry out in
pain if they recognized a poison in your food.  Your clothes would
always keep you dry and at a comfortable temperature, despite being
thin and light, and would never rip or stain.  You would know
everything about whoever you met before they told you, and you would
know whenever you were in danger.  You could reach the top of the
highest tree or through the narrowest keyhole, and hear a whisper
across the city if it had your name in it.  You could climb walls like
Spider-Man, fly through the air like a bird, or run faster than a
horse; you could send objects flying to wherever you wished.  You
could call down lightning and fire to destroy your enemies, or turn
them to stone, mud, or pillars of salt.  Your house would clean
itself, and it would change its appearance as you wished.

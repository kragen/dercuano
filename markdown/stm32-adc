The analog-to-digital converter on even the most basic models of STM32
is capable of a million samples per second, about 70 times faster than
the 15ksps advertised for the ADCs on the 8-bit AVR line, which
Arduino was built on.  The “leakage” or bias current is specified as
<200nA, which is adequate for many measurement tasks even without an
external preamp.  Some new “Arduino” boards are built around an
STM32F103C8T6, which has two 1Msps ADCs, and thus ought to be able to
digitize signals at 2Msps with a bit of clever programming — enough
for signals of up to 1MHz.  (ST application note AN3116 has details.)
It has 20KB of zero-wait-state SRAM, which is enough to capture
several thousand samples, which ought to be enough.

There are many possible uses for such a capability.  One highly
desirable use is to make an oscilloscope, a general-purpose instrument
for visualizing a small number of quantities changing quickly, once
the quantities are converted to voltages.  (By “small number” I mean
“less than five” and by “quickly” I mean “over nanoseconds to
milliseconds”).  Unfortunately, 1MHz is not enough — a low-quality
off-brand analog oscilloscope is 10MHz, and a normal entry-level
analog oscilloscope is 20MHz, which doesn’t mean it can’t detect
faster signals, just that they suffer 6dB/octave attenuation and
severe phase distortion.  So 2Msps is about 5% of an oscilloscope.

Here’s an exploration of possible ways to get to something a bit more
decent.

Software flash conversion
-------------------------

The STM32 is capable of acquiring data at much higher speeds using its
GPIO lines; it can read 16 of them at once, something like 36 million
times per second.  Configured as digital inputs, these are
Schmitt-trigger lines; some are 5V-tolerant, with LOW guaranteed up to
0.475Vdd - 0.33 V, HIGH guaranteed from 0.5Vdd + 0.2 V, and ≈100mV
hysteresis; and others are not, with LOW guaranteed up to 0.3Vdd +
0.07 V, HIGH guaranteed from 0.445Vdd + 0.398V, and ≈200mV
hysteresis.  This leaves a narrow voltage range of 500–800mV
undefined.  All have input leakages of 1μA or less.

It occurs to me that you could perhaps use this capability to acquire
lower-precision data about higher frequencies, which might still be
valuable.  You could experimentally characterize the analog behavior
of the chips, and perhaps generate waveforms for field-calibration of
the chip.  Then you could use a 16-bit digital input port and a
17-resistor ladder fed from a buffer as a 4-bit flash converter, and
maybe do some kind of half-flash trick largely in software to get to 8
bits.

4 or even 8 bits may sound extremely unimpressive, but often the
high-frequency signal is small in amplitude compared to the
lower-frequency components; certainly when the signal contains both,
the high-frequency components alone will have smaller amplitude than
the overall signal.  In particular, this means it’s safe to use an
ac-coupled or inverting amplifier on the input.  And flash conversion
is easily capable of digitizing according to a nonlinear scale, such
as ISDN μ-law.  But the most interesting possibility is using a bit of
external analog circuitry to dynamically adjust the range of the
high-frequency digitization to approximate the range of the
jury-rigged ADC.

An external fucking ADC obviously
---------------------------------

Well duh.  The TI ADC08060 is a 3V 8-bit 20–60Msps parallel-output
ADC, and you can just hook it up to 8 GPIO pins and bingo.  There are
others out there.  They barely cost more than a STM32F103, although
other STM32 chips are cheaper.

Running the ADC at lower precision 
-----------------------------------

As explained in file `stm32`, it’s possible to configure the ADC for
lower bit depth (10, 8, or 6 bits) to speed it up (to 928, 785, or 643
ns, respectively), which suggests you could crudely digitize signals
up to 780 kHz with one STM32 ADC, or up to 1.56 MHz with two.

Ganging up STM32s
-----------------

At the 1Msps rate, each conversion takes 14 clock cycles of a 14MHz
clock, of which only 1.5 cycles (107 ns) are spent sampling the
signal.  This means that frequency components up to about 9MHz are
basically unattenuated, though aliased, in the output, and the first
actual zero of the frequency response is 9.3 MHz.  The STM32F103C8T6
can run its two ADCs in lockstep so as to sample precisely every 7
cycles, but you could easily imagine a scheme for syncing up 5–20
STM32s to sample at slightly staggered times, thus capturing signals
up to 9MHz in their full glory.

For some time I’ve dreamed of towns where all the building is
underground, and the surface is devoted to soil — gardens and
parks — but with some exposed windows to the sky.  Subterranean
construction faces a number of objections, one of which is a concern
that it will be dim and dark, due to a lack of natural light.

We can achieve natural lighting conditions in almost entirely
underground construction, with populations at low-urban densities,
despite agriculture sustainability.

What it looks like
------------------

You’re standing on a grassy, gently rolling hill, in the shade of a
tree-sized sculpture, sort of shaped like a rotifer or sea lily, with
a cap some five meters across and eight meters tall atop a
three-meter-tall stalk that must be metal to support that much weight,
although it looks like sandstone.  The stalk is some 1.5m across, and
the sandstone is warm to the touch if you put your arms around it.
The cap is not vertical, and the stalk is not straight; it bends
noticeably towards the southwest.

A flagstone path winds its way down the hill; a bit further down, it
runs between some bamboo boxes containing raised-bed gardens, some
filled with a mix of leafy deep green plants, leafy purple plants, and
flowers, and tall stalks of corn, while others contain clearly
recognizable onions mixed with staked-up tomatoes and eggplants.  No
other buildings are in sight, just gardens, hills, forests, and
waterways, and a few other organically shaped sculptures.

You walk down the sunny flagstone path between the gardens to a narrow
brook, only about a meter wide but flowing slowly along its meander.
A stepping stone beckons you across, but you follow the flagstones
along its bank.  A mix of trees lines its other bank, none more than
about three meters tall, because this is a new forest; it’s dominated
by fast-growing pines that are culled once slower-growing fruit trees
have been nurtured in their shade.  A clump of four-meter-tall bamboo,
some culms three centimeters across, is visible a bit upstream.

A few meters downstream, the brook splashes down a little cataract
into a pond, some seven meters across.  Through the water of the pond,
you can see the pond bottom clearly.  Among its algae, you can see a
number of rocks on the bottom; although many are opaque, as one
normally expects, some of them are round and shining, like ovoids of
dark glass.  By the side of the pond is a weeping willow.  Trails of
bubbles are coming up on part of the pond’s surface.

Another grassy hill is next to the pond; over its crest is visible a
sort of wooden arch, standing alone, with what appears to be a large
wooden snailshell atop it.  The flagstone path curves around the hill.
Rather than accepting the pond’s invitation to swim, you follow it
past a pink granite boulder protruding from the side of the hill.
There is a three-meter-wide circular door in the boulder.  You touch
it and enter, ducking slightly and closing the ponderous door behind
you with little effort, due to its high-precision bearings.  It seals
tightly.

You are in a three-meter-wide corridor with an arched ceiling, sloping
down into the hill and beyond.  Although it’s not as blinding as the
sunny meadow outside, it’s brightly illuminated from all sides; the
walls have the appearance of stained-glass windows, a brilliant glow
from within illuminating the deep blues and reds that form the images
on their surface.

The air in the corridor smells fresh, despite the apparent hermetic
seal on the door and lack of noticeable draft inside.

You walk down the mild slope of the corridor, past a door labeled
STAIRS near the entrance, past some 24 meters of the luminous murals,
around a bit of a curve, past some benches, to a grouping of three
large doors at the end of the corridor, two made from laminated bamboo
and one apparently a dark-stained hardwood.  The top of your head is
now a bit lower than the threshold of the door through which you
entered.  You knock on the door of your host.

They open the door to welcome you.  You enter, noticing that the door
is quite a bit heavier than you would expect a laminated bamboo door
to be.

The apartment is nearly circular, some 11 meters across, and as
brightly illuminated and fresh-smelling as the corridor.  It is nearly
silent; the machine noises we often hear in conventional housing, from
refrigerators, computers, air conditioners, etc., are completely
absent.  Also, there are no cars outside, and even if there were, the
noise would not reach you underground.  You hear only the sounds of
your friend and yourself.

The walls here are white plaster, smoothly curving into the ceiling,
rather than the luminous stained-glass look of the entry corridor.
The upper parts of the walls and ceilings are illuminated by what
seems to be sunlight, shining up at it from tiny alcoves in the walls.
The ceilings are only three meters high, no higher than those of the
corridor, because you are barely below ground at this point.

A 2-meter-wide round hole in the floor of the four-meter-across round
room in the center of the apartment has a bamboo railing around it,
providing a view to the four-meter-tall lower story.  An archway on
the outer edge of the apartment, near the door to the corridor, leads
to a gently sloping two-meter-wide helical ramp curving around the
perimeter of the apartment; after almost one and a half turns, this
reaches the floor below, rendering the entire apartment wheelchair-
accessible without elevators.

The total floor area of the apartment, not counting this outer helical
ramp, is some 190m² (2045 sq ft); it is divided into ten rooms of
different sizes, with different ceiling heights.  The central
downstairs room has a two-meter-wide hole in its four-meter-high
ceiling leading to the three-meter-tall upstairs, for a total of over
seven meters; while other parts of the downstairs have lofts for
storage built over them, lowering the normally four-meter ceilings
down to 2½ meters, and there are even a few alcoves where an adult
cannot stand comfortably.

Different parts of the apartment are illuminated by different ways and
to different degrees.  Some parts have quartzite and agate protruding
from the walls, brilliantly glowing from within; other parts have the
ceilings flooded with sunlight; others have the stained-glass effect
from the entry corridor.

There is another emergency-exit door labeled STAIRS in the lower story
of the apartment, and also another mysterious door, which turns out to
link to an on-demand electric very-light-rail system allowing you to
travel to other nearby houses even when it’s snowing at speeds of
40 kph (11 m/s).

What “natural lighting” normally means in architecture
------------------------------------------------------

[Brian Knight explains][0] (confirmed by [the Passive Solar
Primer][3]) that for passive winter solar heating of homes, you want
9–12% of the floor area of the house in south-facing windows, in the
context of the 35° north latitude of Asheville, NC.  “More than 12
percent puts the house at risk of overheating unless the design
includes extra thermal mass,” he explains.  This tells us that we can
get enough natural light to make people happy with our architecture
with only about 10%.

[0]: http://www.wncgreenbuilding.com/articles/full/here_comes_the_sun
[3]: http://www.nmsea.org/Education/Homeowners/Passive_Solar_Primer.php

But that’s not 10% of the sunlight; that’s 10% of the floor area in
the form of vertical south-facing windows.  At 35° latitude, you’re
only getting about sin(35°) ≈ 57% of that amount of sunlight, a bit
more in summer, a lot less in winter.  If you’re getting the light
from windows facing the heavens instead of standard horizontal
windows, you only need about 5.7% of the roof space to gather the
necessary light.  And that illumination will be stabler throughout the
year.

Photovoltaic-powered electrical lights are a bad idea
-----------------------------------------------------

Now, one thing you could do would be to try to do it with photovoltaic
solar panels, and run electrical lights from them.  The problem with
this is that normal solar panels are only 16% efficient, and the
[luminous efficiency][1] of a regular lightbulb is only 2%, a
quartz-halogen bulb can reach 3.5%, compact fluorescents and LED lamps
are typically about 10%, while sunlight is 13.6% (because only [37% of
its light is within the visible band][2], and much of that is far from
our photopic sensitivity peak).  That means that every lumen of
sunlight can only convert to about 16% × 10% / 13.6% ≈ 0.12 lumens of
artificially generated light indoors.  So instead of 5.7% of the roof
space, you’d need about 48% of the roof space for solar panels for
illumination alone, not leaving much space for anything else.

[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficacy
[2]: http://physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/papers/lumens-per-watt.pdf "Maximum Efficiency of White Light, Tom Murphy, July 31, 2011"

Lightpipes are a good idea
--------------------------

[Light pipes] (or light tubes, or lightguides) are like fiber optics,
but thicker.  Big ones can be silvered on the inside, like a thermos,
and filled with air; small ones can be solid or water-filled.  The
light suffers [a 4% Fresnel loss][5] upon entry and upon exit, plus
some absorption on the way down.  (This absorption can be advantageous
if you want to reduce infrared and ultraviolet in order to increase
the illumination-to-heat and illumination-to-sunburn ratio; but
ultraviolet absorption by Biosphere 2’s regular glass roof resulted in
ecological problems within, so beware.)

[4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_tube
[5]: http://www.avagotech.com/docs/5988-7057EN

Typical lightpipes can carry 70% to 90% of the sunlight fed into them
for many meters.  Optical concentration (imaging or [nonimaging][6])
can concentrate multiple square meters of sunlight into a lightpipe
whose cross section is a fraction of a square meter.

[6]: https://www.psa.es/webesp/projects/solarsafewater/documents/curso/dia_14/8.%20Manuel%20Collares.pdf#page=16&zoom=auto,565,-141

So, supposing that you want to illuminate a 50m² subterranean
apartment to conventional “natural lighting” levels.  You can gather
sunlight from a 50m² × 5.7% ÷ 80% ≈ 3.6m² area on the surface, stuff
it through a 20cm-diameter 80% efficient lightpipe to carry it down to
your apartment (leaving the infrared and ultraviolet up on the
surface), and let the other 46.4m² of sunlight nourish your garden and
park.  Perhaps you can put the solar collector a couple of meters
above the ground as a sort of artificial shade tree — the rotifer and
snailshell sculptures mentioned in the introduction.

Needing 7.2% of your surface area (per underground story) is much
better than needing 48% of it.

Illuminating the 190m² subterranean apartment in the illustration to
this level will require shading almost 14m² at the surface.  The
rotifer sculpture mentioned at the beginning would have a mouth area
of up to 19.6m²; the seven-meter-wide pond totals about 38.5m², and if
the glass stones on its bottom cover 36% of the bottom, they would
collect a similar amount of sunlight.

Nonimaging optics are [limited to a concentration factor][6] of
C_max = n²/sin²θ, where n is the index of refraction at the absorbing
aperture (1 if you’re doing it just via reflection) and θ is the
maximum angle from the optical axis at which you’re gathering the
light (the half-angle of the radiation cone apex).  The rotifer
sculpture might have a concentrating parabolic reflector of 2.2m
radius at the mouth, concentrating down to a lightpipe throat of 75cm
radius inside its sandstone-finish stem; that’s a concentration factor
of 8.6, which limits it to collecting sunlight from no more than 20°
off-axis, or a total of a 40° arc through the sky, unless you turn the
rotifer to track the sun a bit, or feed multiple sculptures into the
house, each covering part of the sky.  Note that the tropics are
almost 47° apart, so you’ll probably have to reorient the rotifer
seasonally at least.

[6]: https://books.google.com.ar/books?id=hrKcNlXPu88C&lpg=PA1&ots=xTTRqQunCL&dq=non-imaging%20optical%20concentrator&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q=non-imaging%20optical%20concentrator&f=false

Note that if you can track the sun perfectly, the theoretical maximum
without refraction is ≈1/sin²(0.54°), or about 11000 — about 11MW/m²
or 1100W/cm².

You can trade off azimuthal field of view for elevational field of
view for a given concentration, though; in the extreme of an east-west
trough concentrating reflector, you could get the same 8.6-sun
concentration by orienting the trough within 6.68° (or 6.68° - 0.54°,
really) of coplanar to the plane of the sun’s nearly-planar apparent
motion.

Agricultural sustainability
---------------------------

The apartment described in our introductory anecdote occupies some
133m² just below the surface, although it has considerably more floor
area than that because of its two stories.  It could host a fairly
large number of people; it’s exceedingly spacious for just one or two
people.  It might become a bit of a pain to clean, in fact.

But the smallest number I’ve been able to convince myself of, for
agricultural sustainability, is 50m² of cultivated area per person,
using soybeans, dwarf corn, and ample soil amendments.  In colder
climates, even approaching this level of productivity requires
greenhouses and similarly extreme measures.  And if only some of the
surface is gardened, in order to leave some of it for forests, brooks,
and light collection, you need more space.  And lower-labor
agricultural systems like apple orchards are also lower productivity
per hectare.  (Mature tall-spindle apple orchards [can yield 1000
bushels per acre per year][7]; at [40 pounds per bushel][8] and [52
kcal per 100g][9] that’s 2331 kcal/m²/year (310mW/m²!) which is about
⅐ of the raw productivity of high-yielding conventional agricultural
systems like corn.  Supposedly [netting and Tatura training][10] can
close most of the gap, but I’m skeptical, and anyway that moves the
apples back into the high-maintenance intensively-cultivated
category.)

[9]: https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/usda/apples?portionid=58449&portionamount=100.000
[10]: http://www.goodfruit.com/calculate-target-yield/

Anyway, let’s say you need 100m² per person for gardening.  Then 150m²
per person gives you some space for meadows and forests and whatnot,
too.  That’s 6700 people per square kilometer; [this compares
reasonably to many current cities][12], such as Dalian at 7100, Rio de
Janeiro at 6850, Bangkok at 6450, London at 5100, Athens at 5400, the
Buenos Aires metropolitan area at 4950 (Buenos Aires proper is 14000),
Moscow at 4900, Berlin at 3750, Accra at 3300, Quito at 3150, and
Los Angeles at 2750.

Emergency escape
----------------

The plan described in the introductory anecdote features a number of
heavy doors that close tightly.  The door to the outdoors is like this
in order to facilitate indoor climate control, but the others are that
way for fire-escape reasons: you need to be able to reach a fire
escape that’s sealed off with a fire door without having to travel too
far.  So the door that appears to be laminated bamboo is actually a
steel fire-door core with laminated-bamboo surfaces, so that fires or
chemical releases inside one apartment don’t render the escape route
for the others unviable.

Medieval fortress defensibility scale
-------------------------------------

I ran into a [fascinating discussion of medieval sieges][11] the other
day; one of the discussants said:

> There is usually a balance that prevents long long term sieges...a
> large population is capable of fully defending the walls and keeping
> the invaders out, but consume more resources and shorten the time
> that they can hide behind walls. A smaller force will consume less
> resources and hold out for longer, but they risk not being able to
> defend the walls fully due to lack of man power.

[11]: https://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/questions/17053/how-long-can-a-medieval-siege-last

But of course a sufficiently large fortress doesn’t suffer from this
problem, because its ratio of arable land to walls becomes arbitrarily
large; and this happens sooner if productivity per acre is high.
Leaving aside motte-and-bailey-type fortresses where the food is grown
*outside* the fortress in the bailey, what’s the scale at which the
lifestyle outlined in this scenario would become able to defend a
hypothetical wall?

Suppose we need one defender per two meters of wall.  Then a circle
300 meters across would have 942 m of wall around it, and also
471 × 150m² of land inside of it, and therefore be able to support 471
inhabitants, sufficient to defend that wall.  309 meters across would
support 500 inhabitants.

This is a size sufficiently larger than Dunbar’s number that you would
probably need some kind of official power structure within it.

Clustering
----------

In the example scenario, you have three apartments that access the
surface through the same entry tunnel.  In practice, you might want to
cluster houses together more than that; there are great advantages to
being able to borrow a hammer or some yeast from your neighbor without
having to walk 100 meters, and in particular there are advantages to
serendipitous meeting and chit-chat with neighbors.  If you cluster
groups of ten such apartments together, and figure two inhabitants per
apartment, everybody’s gardens are a little further off (2000m², for
the 100m² of gardens for 20 people, excluding parks, has a radius of
25 meters), but they’ll encounter each other much more often, and
forests and ponds can be proportionally larger; and in the fortress
case, you can go slightly motte-and-bailey and actually locate the
parks for the outside the fortress walls, leaving only the arable land
inside.

This allows you to reduce your 309-meter-across circle by about 30
meters: the 14 or so clusters around the outside shrink to 2000m²
each, leaving the other 11 or so clusters in the middle with 3000m²,
for a total area of 61000m² and thus only 279 meters of diameter, or
only 877 meters of outer wall.

The Subway
----------

I said there was an on-demand light rail.  Specifically, what I have
in mind is kind of like a horizontal elevator; a small capsule comes
when you call it, and then takes you where you want to go, and is
computer-controlled so it won’t hit other capsules and you don’t have
to pay attention to driving it.  Suppose, as above, that you have
clusters of ten apartments containing 20 people, and your overall
community is 309 meters across and 500 people, spread over a total of
25 stations.  Each station, except the first, needs to be connected to
at least one other station, and the stations are about 60 meters
apart, so you need at least 1440 meters of tube.  Say 1800 to be on
the safe side, allowing for sidings and redundant loops.  At an
average of 5m/s you need 12 seconds to get to the next station and 60
seconds to get all the way across town.  And you might have to wait 15
seconds for a spare capsule to come pick you up.

(Note that this 1800 is 3.6 meters per inhabitant, i.e. tiny in cost.)

The tube can be quite narrow.  Suppose the capsules are designed to
accommodate up to six people, two abreast, or one abreast if it’s a
wheelchair; the cabin can be two meters wide, 1½ meters tall, and
three meters long.  The tube can be 2½ meters wide and 2 meters tall,
so the 1800 meters of tube suggested above work out to 4500m², or 9m²
or 18m³ per inhabitant.

Also, the capsules, rails, and power cables (or shafts, or whatever)
can be fairly light.  Six people weigh 600kg or less, normally;
accelerating 600kg to 11m/s over 30m takes about 6 seconds, which
means it’s about 1m/s² (a comfortable 0.1 gees), 600N, with a peak
power of 6600W or a bit under 9 horsepower.  [Amazon sells a
1½-horsepower motor for pool water pumps][12] for US$250 (the Hayward
SPX2710Z1M); it weighs 27.7 pounds (12.6kg), so we can figure that a
durable 9 horsepower would weigh 75kg and cost about US$1500.
(Starter motors can be similar in power and weigh much less, but pool
water pump motors are sold to run for hours continuously every day,
not for a second or two a few times a month.)

[12]: http://www.amazon.com/Hayward-SPX2710Z1M-2-Horsepower-Threaded-Replacement/dp/B005INZ090/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&qid=1431559952&sr=8-17&keywords=10+horsepower+motor

So the whole capsule might weigh 800kg and need 12 horsepower of
motors ( to hit its target speed.  That’s ten kilowatts of electricity,
which would be 21 amps at 480 volts — very easy to supply with no
significant loss with a third rail.  Given the short distances and the
availability of rails, you could maybe even use 48 volts at 210 amps,
eliminating the risk of electrical shock, although you could still get
creamed by a capsule on its way through the station.

A single capsule would need 84 round trips (168 minutes) to transport
the entire population from one extreme of the town to the other, so
you might need some ten capsules in total, one for every 50 people;
this would allow 12% of the population to be in transit at any given
time, if necessary.  That’s a total of US$30 worth of motor per
person, and maybe another US$30 or US$100 worth of capsule
construction.

I don’t know how heavy train rails need to be to support a
800-kilogram mini-train.  [Standard axle loads][13] are 19.3 tonnes
per axle running on rails that weigh about 44.6 kg/m; here we’re
talking about 0.4 tonnes per axle, which (with linear extrapolation)
would work on 0.92 kg/m rail, which is like a fifteenth of normal
“light rail” rail.  That would be a total of about 1700kg of steel for
the system as a whole, or 3.4kg per inhabitant.

[13]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axle_load

(In fact, you could go even chintzier: mountain bike tires are up to
57mm wide and can reasonably have a 15cm contact patch at 50 psi, so
they can support up to 300kg each.  Four wheels with mountain bike
tires would work.)

If you were to scale a system like this one up, its 11m/s top speed
would allow you to cross Buenos Aires, which is about 18km across at
its widest point, in 27 minutes, plus half a minute to walk 30m to the
nearest station and 10 seconds for a capsule to arrive.  If you could
double the top speed to 22m/s (79 km/h, 49mph; this would not require
bigger motors, only accelerating for four times as long) then you
could cut it to 14 minutes.  Currently crossing Buenos Aires from
Puente Saavedra to Villa Riachuelo in the bus takes 85 minutes on the
28 or 21 bus, which travel along the freeway.  If you take the 76 and
150 through the city instead, it’s 109 minutes.  And often you have to
walk for hundreds of meters to reach the bus stop and wait there for
tens of minutes.

Given the advantages of this kind of transportation system, which
would cost US$95 of vehicle, 3.4kg of steel rail, and 18m³ of tunnel
excavation per inhabitant even at the low urban density of 6700/km².
As urban distances go down, the cost of rail and tunnel should go down
proportionally.  So having built such a system in Buenos Aires, with
its 14000/km² population, would have been enormously useful.

Gordon Mohr suggests that you could recharge at subway stations
instead of having a third rail.  60 seconds at 3kW is only 180kJ; at
the 18kJ/kg of current supercapacitors, you’d only need 10kg or so of
them.  If you could recharge as you zipped through each station, you’d
only need 6 seconds, or 18kJ.  [Amazon will sell you 2.7V 10F
capacitors][14] for US$2.84; they can store 36 J, so 18 J of capacity
would cost you US$1420, comparable to the motor.

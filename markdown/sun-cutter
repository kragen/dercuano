Could you replace a laser cutter with a focused-sunlight cutter?

I mean obviously you can burn through things with focused
sunlight — I’ve been doing it since I was a kid — but I’m asking if
you can match the performance of off-the-shelf low-power laser
cutters.

The laser cutter I’ve been using to cut MDF cuts a 100-μm kerf
positioned with 60-μm precision using a 60W laser through 3-mm MDF at
24 mm/sec, although it can handle up to I think 12 mm at lower speeds.
If we figure that the divergence of the beam can’t be more than about
50 μm over those 3 mm, that’s about a sixtieth of a radian, 16.7 mrad,
almost twice the visible width of the sun, which is about 9.3 mrad.

Optics won’t work
-----------------

So there are two problems here: one is to focus, say, 100 W of
sunlight in an area that’s less than 100 μm across, and the other is
to keep the divergence of that focused beam down below, say, 10 mrad.

The very direct approach is to use a single movable parabolic
reflector at a sufficiently large distance.  But this will not work
very well.  100 W is about 0.1 m² of sunlight at the surface, a mirror
of 357 mm diameter; this is 10 mrad at a distance of 35.7 m.  A
geometrically-perfect image of the sun at that distance would be 9.3
mrad, which would make a 332-mm-wide image of the sun, which is
substantially larger than the 0.1 mm we are shooting for.

This amounts to a spot that is 3½ orders of magnitude too wide and is
7 orders of magnitude too dim.

Getting a smaller and thus brighter image from an imaging-optics
system involves shortening the focal length, as all photographers
know.  The desired power density here is 10 GW/m², which is (not
totally coincidentally) 7 orders of magnitude brighter than sunlight.

This is somewhat problematic because the illuminance limit imposed by
thermodynamic reversibility is for the focal spot to be entirely
surrounded by (reflected or refracted) sun surface, that is, 4π
steradians of sun.  A 9.3 milliradian cone has a solid angle of about
0.27 millisteradians (2π(1 - cos(9.3 mrad))), and so the theoretical
maximum is only about 46000 suns, with 23000 suns being the limit for
a point on a flat surface only being illuminated from outside the
surface.  This is still three orders of magnitude dimmer than the
laser — and without even being pulsed!

Therefore even non-imaging optics can’t help us here.  We need
stronger stuff than mere optics.

One possibility is to concentrate the light optically as far as
possible, then use some other approach to deliver the power to a small
area.  We don’t actually have to violate any laws of thermodynamics to
do this; the MDF doesn’t have to get hotter than the surface of the
sun (5500°), and we don’t have to deliver all of the energy to it, but
can waste some in pumping heat around.  One obviously feasible
approach is to use photovoltaic panels to power the existing electric
CO₂ laser, but are there more direct routes, maybe more efficient
ones?

Hot fluid flow
--------------

One obvious (to me) example is to use the sunlight to heat a fluid to
a sufficiently high temperature and then cause the fluid to flow
through the MDF.  Air is one possibility, although it might tend to
catch the MDF on fire even more than the laser does.  Lead, which
doesn’t dissolve much iron and doesn’t boil until 1749°, is another
possibility; at higher temperatures, copper, which doesn’t melt until
1084° but doesn’t boil until 2562°, or silver, which melts at 962° and
boils at 2162°, might resist oxidation better.  (Molten silver,
however, has a tendency to attack steel.)

### Air is probably going to be too difficult ###

How fast could air deliver power?  Suppose the hot air stream is
limited to 1600° in order to be able to use ordinary ceramics to
control it; air’s specific heat is 29.2 J/K/mol, and it weighs about
30 g/mol.  Let’s suppose that the MDF cools the hot air down to about
500°, so we have 1100 K to play with.  Delivering 60 W then requires a
flow of about 1.9 millimoles per second, which works out to about
56 mg/s, which would be 56 mℓ/s at normal temperatures — but at 1600°
it’s more like 360 mℓ/s.  Dividing that by the area of a 50-μm-radius
circle, we get the utterly implausible air speed of 46 km/s, roughly
Mach 138.

(I would have liked to use metals, but even superalloys are limited to
about 1000°.)

If we relax the requirements considerably, we can get into a feasible
range; suppose that we make our air nozzle out of white-hot quicklime
instead of regular ceramics, so that we can use air at 2600° (reducing
the flow rate to 290 mℓ/s), and make the air stream 1 mm in diameter
instead of 100 μm.  Then we can get the air speed down to 370 m/s,
Mach 1.1, which is probably feasible.  (Turbulence in the nozzle just
transforms into more heat in the air!)  A slightly wider nozzle of
1.35 mm diameter can get your gas stream speeds down to 200 m/s, which
is quite clearly feasible.  But if you’re blowing white-hot air on it,
it’s going to be really difficult to keep the MDF from catching on
fire; you probably need an inert-gas atmosphere, nitrogen at least,
which probably means you need to filter and recirculate it.

### Lead is more feasible ###

Molten metal is probably a much more feasible approach; even at room
temperature, it’s about ten thousand times as dense as air, and that
advantage increases with temperature rather than decreasing.

Lead’s vapor pressure is a still-relatively-safe 10 Pa at 814° (an
atmosphere is 101 kPa).  Tin is a more expensive but nontoxic
alternative with an even lower melting point (232°), an even higher
boiling point (2602°), and an even lower vapor pressure; I think it is
more vulnerable than lead to oxidation in air.  The eutectic 63%-tin
mixture of the two melts even lower.

If we figure that we can work from 900° down to lead’s freezing point
of 327°, then take advantage of its 4.8 kJ/mol heat of fusion, how
much lead flow do we need?  Its molar mass is 207.2 g/mol, so that’s
23 kJ/kg of latent heat of fusion.  [Engineering Toolbox says][0]
molten lead’s heat capacity is 140 J/kg/K, and we have 573 K here, so
that’s 80 kJ/kg of sensible heat.  Together, they’re 103 kJ/kg, so our
flow rate is only 580 mg/s; with molten lead’s density of about
10.7 g/cc, that’s only 58 microliters per second of lead.

Through a 100-micron-diameter circle, that’s still 7.4 meters per
second, which is some pretty healthy metal pumping action; I don’t
know what molten lead’s viscosity is, but that won’t be easy.  But
it’s surely feasible.

Hmm, [this IAEA document on nuclear reactor design][1] says lead’s
dynamic viscosity is about 1 mPa·s in the temperature range
considered.  A Poise is 100 mPa·s.  [Water’s viscosity at 20° is 1.002
mPa·s][2], so we can treat lead as especially dense water in this
temperature range.  This document also describes in some detail the
physical properties of the lead-bismuth eutectic coolant used in many
Soviet reactors.  [Some random engineering calculator site][3] claims
that 1 mm of 0.1 mm-diameter pipe at 58 μℓ/s should result in about
13 MPa of head loss; this is a straightforward pressure to achieve,
and it amounts to a force of about 0.1 N across the area of the
nozzle, and a hydraulic power of 750 milliwatts.

These numbers are all easily feasible.

Solar-pumped lasers
-------------------

Another possibility is to use the sunlight directly to pump a lasing
medium, such as a doped fiber; this is called a “solar-pumped laser”,
and there are apparently a number of them around, mostly Nd:YAG,
including a megawatt one in Uzbekistan (!).

Arcosanti was Paolo Soleri's project to build the city of the future
in the Arizona desert.  The Venus Project is Jacque Fresco's project to build 
it in the Florida swamps.  They have been noticeably less successful than
other efforts such as Burning Man, which gives the appearance of
having been inspired more by _Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome_ than _Star
Trek_, or Dubai.  One of the cornerstones of Soleri's vision was the
"arcology", a kind of building-sized self-sufficient city.

Here I try to imagine what kind of arcology I would like to live in.

Some of this will probably seem outdated in a short decade or two, in
particular my concern for energy conservation.  Rather than seeing a
movement toward energy self-sufficiency in small groups, I think we'll
see something like another decade of energy scarcity, ending around
2026, as bigger and bigger fractions of the globe are devoted to
harvesting solar energy, now that it's finally become cheaper than
fossil-fuel or nuclear energy.

## The population density question ##

A basic question about such structures is how much population density
they can accommodate.  For self-sufficiency, they must necessarily use
no more energy than they can harvest from their environment; in the
simplest case, with no deep drilling and fracking to harvest
geothermal and no nuclear reactors, this is merely the solar energy
available to them.

The [NREL Solar Resource Maps][0] show a photovoltaic solar resource
of 125–250W/m² in the US, which they have unfortunately chosen to
state in non-SI units as 3–6 kWh/m²/day.

[0]: http://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html

This is necessarily the energy supply before the inefficiencies of
conversion to electricity; the solar constant above the atmosphere is
only 1400W/m², the sun only shines at most half the time for 700W/m²,
and it's not direct all of that time; reaching 250W/m² *after*
photovoltaic conversion would imply panel efficiencies of 50%, which
has not yet been achieved.

A human being normally needs to eat 100–120 W (unfortunately typically
rendered in non-SI units as 2000–2500 kcal/day), equivalent to about
5–6 mg/s of carbohydrates or protein, in addition to micronutrients;
but micronutrient needs can be satisfied at an insignificant energy
cost.

(For brevity, I'll frequently use the Chinese 人 to mean "person" in
what follows.)

Dividing these two numbers, we have an *absolute maximum* population
density of about one or two people 
per square meter in temperate areas like the US.  A standard
100-meter-square city block could then accommodate some ten or twenty
thousand people, which works out to one or two million per km².
[Wikipedia tells me][1] this is much higher than any real city:

However, real solar plants (see the "Utilities → Food" section below) don't
even approach 100% conversion efficiency, nor does any known means of
conversion of sunlight to electrical, chemical, or mechanical energy.
Typical large-scale electrical efficiencies are 16% for the sunlight
that hits the panels, but the panels are placed some distance apart so
they don't shade each other when the sun angle is suboptimal — since
panels are so much more expensive per m² than sunny land, emphasis is
placed on not wasting panels, rather than not wasting land — so
typical yields are more like [11W/m² for Optisolar's Sarnia
project][47], 6.25 ac/MW = 40W/m² for Nevada Solar One, 15.5MW/85
acres = 45W/m² for [SunEnergy1's Duke Energy project][48].

[47]: http://www.ecoworld.com/energy-fuels/utility-scale-photovoltaics.html
[48]: http://www.sunenergy1.com/projects.html

There are currently-shipping mass-producible thin-film panels that hit
20%, space-deployed very expensive multijunction semiconductor panels
that hit 40%, and concentrating solar can hit the usual 35–40% for
large fixed steam turbines.  There are some potential nice synergies
here: photovoltaic panels, including multijunction panels, are nearly
black, so the sunlight that photovoltaic panels fail to convert to
electricity is mostly converted to heat rather than reflected, which
means you can use it to make steam, and concentrating the light means
you can justify the use of much more expensive photovoltaic cells, but
if you're concentrating more than one or two suns on your cell, you'll
need some kind of active coolant to keep the cell from melting — such
as steam!  So in theory you might be able to hit 50% or 60% conversion
efficiency with the combination, but nobody's done it yet.

Modern life involves using energy beyond the bare necessity for
survival, generally quite a lot of it, mostly bought on the market
rather than harvested for direct use.  A self-sufficient arcology
would probably have to be less efficient in its material energy use
than the average person in a modern society, who takes advantage of
economies of scale and specialization in many kinds of goods.  The
[USA DOE EIA AER][3] estimates 2011 marketed energy use in the USA at
97.30 quadrillion Btu/year, another absurd non-SI unit; this quantity
is actually 3.243 terawatts; if we figure 311.8 million people, that's
10.4 kW per person, the equivalent of about 100 slaves per person,
Buckminster Fuller's "energy slaves".

[3]: http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/index.cfm

Let's assume that the overall solar conversion efficiency hits 30%,
rather than 50% or 65% or staying at 16%, and that the overall
electrical energy
use of the inhabitants of the arcology is one-third lower than
current US marketed energy use, for the
following reasons:

- They don't need to heat or cool their houses actively or separately;
  the arcology's surface area per person is much smaller and
  well-insulated, and it uses primarily passive climate control. 
- They spend very little or no energy on actively chilling their food;
  the arcology provides a cold reservoir which provides this service
  free.
- They spend no electrical energy on daytime lighting, because light
  is provided more efficiently through a system of lightguides.
- Because the arcology is self-sufficient, they don't need to spend
  much energy on transporting goods to it, or transporting themselves
  to goods.

If we need 10.4 kW per person, each person would need 83 m² at
125 W/m² or 42 m² at 250 W/m², giving a density of some 12000–24000 
人/km².  If we double this, on the assumption that we'll lose a factor
of 2 in efficiency to generalization, we get 6000-12000 人/km².

XXX what about the factor of 5 in efficiency you lose to current PV
cells? Huh?  I don't think the NREL figures cover that! RECALCULATE
EVERYTHING.  unless NREL *does* cover that.

XXX if I just multiply everything by 5 it stops being an arcology at
all.  Possible optimistic assumptions:

- maybe solar energy efficiency will improve, so that you get, say,
  33% of the light, instead of 20%, due to combining concentrating
  solar with photovoltaic?
- maybe people in an arcology won't use as much energy, because people
  outside an arcology use a lot of energy to heat and cool their
  houses and foods, about half of it; so perhaps they'll use 33% less.
  
With these two 2:3 optimistic assumptions, you use only 4/9 of the
current energy and therefore need only 4/9 of the land area.
  
XXX food refrigeration is perhaps a fundamental utility service!

42 m² by itself is a fairly comfortable, if smallish, apartment.  So
this kind of "arcology" could comfortably be constructed, at first, as
a city block of single-story construction, which means you could
bootstrap it fairly incrementally; you don't have to start with a
megastructure.

But if you want a megastructure — especially a pleasant one — it's far
cheaper to build parts of it all at once, due to certain economies of
scale.

## Envisioning universal luxury dwelling ##

Contrary to the usual Cold-War-era utopias, I don't envision an
above-ground mass of megalomaniacal architect-ego-worship, nor some
kind of giant right rectangular parallelepiped with sad little
rectangular holes in its bare gray concrete walls, nor gleaming cubes
and towers — I'd prefer to leave the above-ground surface as a park,
with crops, meadows, trees, perhaps a forest with some babbling
brooks, and keep the human habitation beneath the ground.  Sunlight
can easily be brought downstairs with the occasional translucent
artificial stone cemented in place below the dirt-line, and
ventilation requires a few wide ventilation towers, which can be
constructed in organic shapes and beautified with vines.

Subterranean dwelling is not a new idea, going back of course to
Paleolithic hunter-gatherers, and [featuring in many science-fiction
stories][12], but here I explore why it's historically been marginal 
(mostly confined to extreme conditions and [military surplus reuse][13]),
why we now have the option to change that, and how completely fucking
awesome it could be.

[12]: http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/prajlich/forster.html "The Machine Stops"
[13]: http://www.wired.com/rawfile/2009/10/missile-base-2/all/

Underground construction is tricky and expensive, particularly in wet
areas where the water table approaches the surface.  Here in Buenos
Aires, each construction site excavation vents a continuous stream of
seepwater into the gutter, proceeding, I suppose, from a pump down at
the bottom of the pit.  Water tends to trickle and seep in through
porous materials like concrete, needing continuous pumping to keep it
from eventually filling your living space.  Less porous building
materials (e.g. concrete sealed with water glass or resins) reduce the
seepage, but they don't eliminate it.  Even [missile silos in the Great
Plains][7] fill up with water when left unattended.

[7]: http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2009/04/gallery_missile_base_1?currentPage=all

There are also risks like collapses, poisonous and asphyxiant gases,
and explosive gases; these three can be minimized during construction
by digging a pit instead of a cave, but in many places, further
measures must be taken after construction to prevent them.

But underground construction has advantages.  Aside from the benefits
of being able to enjoy the land surface as a park, underground
construction is silent, naturally temperature-stable, and much less
vulnerable to terrorist bombing — perhaps not a concern wherever you
live at the moment, but that's what people here in Buenos Aires
thought until Hezbollah blew up the Israeli Embassy and AMIA in the
1990s.

Suppose, though, that instead of a single story of underground
construction, we have ten stories, but still one person per 80 or so
square meters of ground area (6000 人/km², comparable to the density
of Tokyo, in between Los Angeles and San Francisco or Hong Kong).  Now
the average person has 800m² of live/work/storage space, some of it
shared with others, plus 80m² of park; the average couple has 1600m².

This is enough for a sort of underground termite mound of palatial
mansions.  A normal bedroom may occupy some 16m²; 50 of them will fit
into 800m².  Every man, woman, and child could easily own their own
12-bedroom mansion.

[Hearst Castle][49], that classic of robber-baron gilded-age excess
with its 56 bedrooms, occupies some 8400m², so 800m² of floor per
person is enough for truly palatial living.  The question is whether
we can make that kind of thing affordable to everyone.

### Excavation volume and costs ###

Summary: it looks like it costs about US$30k/人 to dig the hole using
current mining methods, although that's still really far from the
fundamental efficiency limits.

#### Volume: 3200m³/人; weight: 7000Mg/人; energy: 1.4GJ/人 or US$20/人 ####

If the average height of a story is 4m — with some
[ceiling height variety][3] to allow some rooms to be cozier and
others more majestic — this is 400k(m³) of excavation, some 3200m³ of
excavation per person, perhaps 7000 tons of dirt and stone to remove.
I have no idea how to estimate the economic cost of this, except that
it is one of those things that has truly enormous economies of scale,
since big strip-mining steam shovels are vastly cheaper per ton of
rock than little backhoes; but the *energy* cost of listing 7000 tons
by an average of 20 meters is some 1.4 gigajoules.

[3]: http://www.jacana.plus.com/pattern/P190.htm

Energy is commonly priced in yet another non-SI unit, the
megawatt-hour (MWh), at typically around US$40 wholesale (US$11/GJ),
and two to five times that retail.  A megawatt-hour is about 3.6
gigajoules, so we're talking about an energy cost of excavation of
some US$20 per person.

(Looking at it another way, at 125 W/m², 1.4 gigajoules per 80m² is
about 39 hours' worth of energy production.)

#### Landscaping excavation techniques would cost US$1.5M/人 ####

Some [random web site][4] says that typical excavation costs are
US$299.64 to US$423.77 per cubic yard (another non-SI unit of some
0.764 m³), which would place the cost of excavation of the above at
some US$1.3–$1.8 million per person.  However, I'm fairly confident
that that's a backhoe cost, not a strip-mining cost, while what I'm
envisioning is more a strip-mining kind of operation (or
"surface-mining", as the miners like to call it these days), followed
by construction and surface restoration.

[4]: http://www.homewyse.com/services/cost_to_excavate_land.html

#### Strip-mining excavation techniques: US$30k/人, 4 months ####

The [Global Surface Mining company web site][5] boasts of a trial
where one of their surface-mining machines removed 830 tonnes of
limestone per hour of operation.  At this rate, you could excavate the
7000 tons for the habitation of one person by using one machine for a
single ten-hour shift; excavating an entire 100-meter-square city
block, digging self-sustaining luxury homes for 125 people, would take
some one to four months.

[5]: http://www.globalsurfacemining.com/limestone-mining.htm

But how much would that really cost?  An online [Open Pit Mine
Model][6] seems like it might be more relevant:

> This mine is an open pit mine producing 5,000 tonnes ore and 5,000
> tonnes waste per day.  The total resource to be mined is 18,715,000
> tonnes.  Ore is hauled 1,068 meters to an ore stockpile.  Waste is
> hauled 535 meters to a waste rock dump.  Rock characteristics for
> both ore and waste are typical of those of granite or porphyritic
> material.  Operating conditions, wage scales, and unit prices are
> typical for western U.S. mining operations.  ... November 2007

Some further figures drawn from that model:

    | Hours per shift          |  10 |
    | Shifts per day           |   2 |
    | Days per year            | 312 |
    | Total Hourly Personnel   |  38 |
    | Total Salaried Personnel |  15 |

    | Supplies & Materials  | $/tonne ore | $2.07 |
    | Labor                 | $/tonne ore |  1.96 |
    | Administration        | $/tonne ore |  0.82 |
    | Sundry Items          | $/tonne ore |  0.48 |
    |-----------------------+-------------+-------|
    | Total Operating Costs |             | $5.33 |

    | Total capital costs | $15,988,500 |

More than half the total capital costs are equipment, including a
single 4½-cubic-meter hydraulic shovel.  There are two four-kilowatt
pumps included, presumably because of the water seepage I mentioned
earlier; that's a heck of a lot of seepage.

[6]: http://costs.infomine.com/costdatacenter/miningcostmodel.aspx

So these guys are spending US$5.33 to remove two tonnes of rock (one
tonne of ore and one tonne of waste), plus their capital cost.  If we
were to use the same equipment and methods to dig a 40-meter-deep
hundred-meter-square hole, removing 875000 tonnes of rock and soil —
let's just call it a million tonnes — then it would have an
*operating* cost of US$2.7 million, and at 10 000 tonnes per day,
would take 100 days, almost four months.  If you divide by the 312/365
days they work, you get 117 days.

If you divide that among 125 people, it's US$21000 per person.  Not
insignificant — certainly much greater than the US$20 per person that
is the inherent cost of the energy to just lift the soil up — but not
an overwhelming cost in the world of construction, either.

But wait!  I haven't accounted for the capital costs yet.  If we
figure an interest and depreciation rate of some 20% per year — high
for the US, but probably reasonable for much of the world — we end up
spending about 6% of the capital cost on interest and depreciation.
That adds up to about US$960k, bringing the total cost to about
US$3.7M, or US$30k/人.  (This is assuming, perhaps optimistically,
that capital line items like "Engineering & Management" and
"Buildings" represent things you could sell without too much loss at
the end of the operation.)

About a third of that cost is labor, and the population of the
dwellings is more than double the size of the digging crew, so it
seems likely that you could reduce the money cost by a third by means
of DIY, or perhaps half or more, if you use methods that are more
labor-intensive and less capital-intensive.

It seems possible that a larger-scale excavation operation would be
more efficient, but given the number of equipment items of which only
a single item is present, it seems likely that a smaller-scale one
would not reduce the cost by much.

These fairly enormous capital equipment investments probably explain
why underground construction is not traditional, because without them,
it's not only dangerous but ruinously expensive.

### Alternative to excavation: build a hill ###

As an alternative that involves moving less dirt, and might help with
water seepage, you could build your arcology essentially above ground,
but then cover it with dirt.  The dirt sloping away from the center
will encourage the water to run off, and so the water table won't rise
toward the center of the hill as much as you think it might; and you
can run drain pipes underground to provide passively-safe drainage and
seep protection for the buildings inside.

This is basically your classic science-fiction pyramid-shaped
arcology, but with a layer of dirt on top of it, and with its outer
walls restricted to a slope of at most 30° above the vertical in order
to keep the soil from slumping off.  Since in this case the base will
be four times as wide as the height, the bh/3 pyramid volume formula
in this case reduces to 16h³/3, times or divided by some minor
deviation from squareness.  If you want it to have the 125 × 80m² × 4m
× 10 = 400k(m³) volume of the previous excavation, it needs to be
about 42 meters tall and 170 meters wide at the base; if its surface
is covered in three meters of soil (vertically, not perpendicularly),
that's about 85000m³ of soil, or about 677m³ per person, less than a
tenth of what you'd have to remove for the excavated version.

A circular mound is slightly taller, narrower, and with less surface
area; a triangular or kidney-shaped one would be the opposite.

While this might seem more handicapped-accessible than the
purely-underground version, you could of course add small hillocks to
that version to provide ramp or elevator access, or
[ordinary small buildings, as in the Terra Vivos entrance near Barstow][9].

[9]: http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-09/can-you-save-house-end-world?single-page-view=true

In the USA, it used to be that once a hill was 1000 feet (almost
305 m) tall, you could call it a "mountain" (although the USGS no
longer has such a hard-and-fast rule).  So if you scale this proposal
up by a linear factor of 8 (an area and population factor of 64, a
volume factor of 512), you get 8000 people living inside an artificial
mountain, each with an average of 25600 m³ (6400 m²).  The
construction cost per person would remain similar.

### Concrete: US$14000–45000/人 ###

Once you have a gigantic hole in the ground, or a building site for a
hill, before you can landscape its roof into a park and start building
mansions and cathedrals inside, you have to build that roof, and also
stop up the seepage from the walls.  As far as I can tell, the
essentially universal technique at this point in history is to use
reinforced concrete, made with portland cement, for floor, pillars,
and ceiling, and either concrete or something similar for the walls to
keep the water out.

It's conceivable that some other kind of construction technique could
work and be cheaper, but I don't know of a candidate.

The surface area of a 100m×100m×40m hole in the ground would be (20000
+ 4*4000)m² = 36000m², so each cm of thickness of concrete means
360m³, or about 900 tonnes, or 7.2 tonnes per person, of concrete that
will be needed.  The surface area of a 170m×170m×42m pyramid would be
(170×170 + 170×170×√5/2)m² = 61000m², 610m³/cm, 1.47Gg/cm, or 11.7
tonnes/cm/人.

Unfortunately, I don't have any idea how thick concrete needs to be
for this kind of construction.  If I guess (I hope reasonably?)  that
it needs to be some 20cm thick, we end up with:

    |              | total concrete | total concrete | concrete mass/人 |
    | square pit   | 7200m³         | 18000 tonnes   | 144 tonnes       |
    | pyramid hill | 12200m³        | 29000 tonnes   | 230 tonnes       |

These numbers are smaller than the amount numbers for the amount of
rock and dirt that need to be removed from the hole, by about two
orders of magnitude, so I assume that the labor cost to put this
amount of concrete in place will be small compared to the labor cost
to dig the whole.  Nevertheless, [concrete costs US$100–200/tonne][8],
so we're looking at a materials cost per person of US$14000–45000.

[8]: http://www.ce.berkeley.edu/~paulmont/CE60New/intr%20_concrete.pdf "Introduction to concrete"

The cement in concrete costs about 330–660kWh/m³, which is to say
1.2–2.4GJ/m^3, to produce.  At US$11/GJ, this is a very small fraction
of the dollar cost of the concrete.  At 10.4kW/人, that's about
33–66h/人/m³, so we're looking at about 80–160 days of the arcology's
population's usual total energy usage to produce the cement; or, if
the arcology were to produce its own cement, 40–160 days of its own
energy harvest.  In practice, it's probably not reasonable to expect
the arcology to be self-sufficient before it's built!

You can probably strengthen the walls substantially and avoid the need
for internal support pillars by making them not flat — like an
eggshell, they should be everywhere convex outward, except possibly t
the bottom — and veining them, like a leaf, an insect's wing, or a
plastic injection-molding.

Once you're done with the excavation and sheathing it in concrete,
you're done with the parts of the traditional construction process
that benefit enormously from economies of scale.  Everything past this
point can be done incrementally without dramatically increasing its
unit cost.

#### Possible future concrete alternative: biocementation ####

I was interested in Magnus Larsson's 2009 "Dune: Arenaceous Anti-
Desertification Architecture" proposal a few years back to cement
desert sands using urea, Bacillus pasteurii bacteria that ferment it
into alkaline carbonate, and calcium chloride to form calcite from the
carbonate; but nothing seems to have come of it, and the process seems
to produce hazardous quantities of ammonia, as anyone who's
inadvertently fermented urea can tell you.  So it might be a cheaper
alternative at some point, but isn't yet; watch Ginger Krieg Dosier's
startup "bioMASON" to see if it works out!  (Dr. Dosier Tweeted me
that in her process, the "by-product is captured in a closed loop
system", by which I assume she means they make their bricks in a
hermetically-sealed chamber and bubble the ammonia through a
sulfuric-acid solution, or maybe just dissolve it in water and recycle
it into new urea.)

If it does work out, we can expect the result to be as hydraulic as
portland cement, slightly less porous, and perhaps significantly
cheaper.  You don't need a cement mixer, the raw materials are urea
and calcium chloride, and you may be able to use aggregate in-situ by
soaking it with the water-soluble cement components. [Portland cement
costs US$110/ton][14], and comprises between a quarter and half of the
mass of concrete, and therefore about a third of its cost.  [Urea
costs about US$400/ton][15], while [calcium chloride costs about
US$200/ton][16]; but the resulting calcium carbonate will not include
most of their mass, since the chloride ion and the majority of the
urea (both its amines, which is to say, everything except its
carbonyl) are merely waste products.

[15]: http://www.indexmundi.com/commodities/?commodity=urea
[16]: http://www.alibaba.com/showroom/calcium-chloride-price.html

Even if it's possible to substitute raw piss for industrial urea, it
would not reduce the cost substantially.  Piss is only about 1% urea,
So you'd need 100 tons of piss per ton of urea, and I think you get 1
mole of carbonate per mole of urea, which is to say 60g of carbonate
or 100g of calcium carbonate per 60g of urea — that's assuming the
other oxygen comes from dissolved O₂, not from more urea molecules —
so you'd need 60 tons of piss per ton of cement, or 8600–14000 tonnes
of piss per person.  At a rate of 1–2 ℓ of piss per person per day,
this would amount to 12–38 millennia of piss production.  Gathering
the piss of millions of people for the construction project would cost
more than simply buying industrially-produced urea.

Reinforced biocement would seem to pose a couple of major problems.
The first, which may not matter in this application, is that calcium
carbonate expands and contracts very little with heat, while portland
cement has an expansion coefficient similar to that of the reinforcing
steel, so reinforced lime cement will tend to crack when exposed to
thermal stress — which hopefully subterranean construction won't
experience!  The second is that chloride ions can corrode the
reinforcing steel even in extremely alkaline environments, so to
reinforce biocement with steel, you probably need a source of calcium
other than calcium chloride.  Unfortunately, the other soluble calcium
salts that occur to me (calcium bromide and calcium iodide) are much
more expensive, and furthermore, I'm not sure they wouldn't cause the
same corrosion.

An alternative that's been sometimes explored in the past, which might
solve both problems, is reinforcing concrete with bamboo rather than
steel.  You need a higher fraction of bamboo than steel to reach the
same strength, but I'm pretty sure chloride doesn't degrade the
cellulose that gives the bamboo its strength.

#### Possible concrete alternative: submarine electro-accumulation ####

As reported [in the March/April 1980 _Mother Earth News_][17], you can
get a concrete-like substance by electrolytically extracting minerals
from seawater on submerged wire armatures; [futurist architect Wolf
Hilbertz][18] founded companies in the 1970s and 1980s to
commercialize the project for, among other things, healing reinforced
concrete that had been damaged by corrosion.  The resulting accretion
on the cathode, principally composed of aragonite and brucite, is
known as "seacrete" or "biorock"; it can grow about 5cm/year, and
[the efficiency is about 400–1500g/kWh][19] (100–400kg/GJ).  The
strength is comparable to concrete when accreted at 5–100mA/ft²
(50–1000mA/m²); typically you use 12V.

[18]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Hilbertz
[19]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seacrete

If it were logistically feasible to use seacrete to construct the
arcology, the 144–230 tonnes needed per person would therefore cost
350–2000GJ, or US$4000–23000.

However, [discussions on the Seasteading fora debate this][20],
claiming the real efficiency is closer to 50g/kWh (14kg/GJ).  If this
is correct, it would push the cost an order of magnitude higher than
concrete.

### Utilities ###

To keep the structure fit for human habitation, it's necessary to
provide light and clean air at comfortable temperature and humidity;
to exhaust or consume CO₂; to prevent the growth of toxic or
allergenic molds; to haul away garbage; to provide food and drinkable
water; to provide means of ingress and egress; to limit the spread of
vermin such as cockroaches, fleas, mosquitoes, mice, and rats; to
contain, ventilate, and neutralize eruptions of noxious chemicals
(say, when some poor dummy foolishly mixes bleach with ammonia while
cleaning — or just when someone has a night of farts with a lot of
hydrogen sulfide, or burns his toast); and to deal with sewage,
ideally by composting and refining it.  It's also highly desirable to
provide electrical energy, internet access, individual climate control
to taste, hot water, compressed air, and vacuum suction for cleaning,
not to mention some way to wash your laundry and stuff.

Many of these problems are simply slightly-larger-scale versions of
the problems that face large contemporary apartment buildings, but
some are not, and some admit better solutions than the traditional
ones.

The compact shape of an arcology makes such utilities easier to
provide.  In the 100×100×40 pit, for example, you have 400k(m³) of
space within a 74-meter radius; you never have to lay more than 74
meters of pipe or duct to reach anywhere.  The corresponding distance
in the pyramid is 119 meters.

#### Light: skylights, lightguides, and electricity at night ####

The most obvious question about living underground: "Won't it be too
dark?"

It depends. It can be a great deal brighter than many current
dwellings.  Aboveground, nobody lives in a glass house, because if you
stop convective and radiative cooling with glass, you get a massive
greenhouse effect, and you can rapidly reach dangerous temperatures —
think of a toddler locked in a closed car in the sunshine.  In
above-ground passive solar design, according to Daniel D. Chiras's
_The Solar House: Passive Heating and Cooling_, typical allowable
glazing on sun-facing walls ranges from 7% to 12% of the floor area,
depending on issues like thermal mass, overhang, and local climate.

That means that the above-ground passive solar houses we think of as
"luminous" and "bright" are already between 88% and 93% dimmer than
direct sunlight, just in order to remain at a livable temperature
without outrageous amounts of heating and air conditioning!

And traditional construction techniques (the picturesque clapboard and
adobe houses we all know from landscape paintings) more or less adhere
to these limits.

##### The skylights: 4m²/人 #####

Bringing 10% of the sunlight underground *would* more or less imply that
10% of the land needs to be skylights.  (You can also illuminate
electrically, but this adds the 80-85% inefficiency of the photovoltaic panel
to the 85% inefficiency of the LED or fluorescent tube, giving you a total of
97-98% loss and therefore requiring 30–50 times as much land area;
better to bring the light inside directly when you can.)

However, first of all, the skylights don't need to look like windows.
They can, and should, take the form of massive glass or glass-like
sculptures, frosted luminous stones, clear-bottomed waterways, or
gigantic artificial formations of quartz, sapphire, fluorite, or salt
crystals; quartz crystals [can be grown at a millimeter per day with
the hydrothermal method][21], and giant thick, but hollow, glass or
acrylic vessels can be filled with a cheap material with a similar
refractive index, such as water.  [LiTraCon-style][22] embedding of
optical fibers in an opaque matrix can even produce mostly-opaque
rocks which nevertheless conduct a substantial fraction of the light
that strikes them down into the ground.

[21]: http://www.roditi.com/SingleCrystal/Quartz/Hydrothermal_Growth.html
[22]: http://wordpress.mrreid.org/2009/07/06/optical-fibres-and-transparent-concrete/

Second, we only really need to illuminate the rooms we're in.  If each
of our 125 inhabitants is, most of the time, in a room of some 3×6
meters, we only need some 2m² of skylight per person — let's say 4m²/人
to be safe, for a total of 500m² out of some 10000m² — and beam the
light down to where we want it using light pipes, either fiber optics
or air-core metallic lightguides.  They don't have to be very
high-quality fiber optics, since the light only has to travel some 40
meters at worst, and losing half of it over that distance is
tolerable, as long as it doesn't damage anything (e.g. melting it).
That is, you could lose 3dB/40m, or 75dB/km, and be fine.

Generally it's a lot easier to increase illuminance than to decrease
it, so it might be a good idea to have a few skylights that focus
sunlight to provide more than one sun of illuminance for
high-illuminance applications.

##### How to carry light down to the depths: lightguides #####

[Lightguide illumination has been deeply investigated already][31] as
a way to illuminate buildings, and it works.  

[31]: http://gaia.lbl.gov/btech/papers/20546.pdf "Light Guide Design Principles, Johnson and Selkowitz, 1986"

For solid fiber-optic lightguides, I think the *circumference* of the
lightguide must be proportional to the absorptivity of the material,
or a bit more, to prevent overheating; this would seem to suggest
bundles of thin lightguide cables so you can blow air through them.
The total power absorbed in the fibers will be quite significant, at
least if you don't use high-quality glass: if you're collecting 500m²
of sunlight at the surface, that's about 500kW, and if you absorb half
of it in the fibers, you need to dissipate 250kW from the fibers.
Liquid-core lightguides could use the liquid itself as the coolant,
providing hot-water heating from the light absorbed from the
lighting system.

Typical optical fibers used today for communication have [attenuation
of about 0.3dB/km][32], which is about 0.012dB in 40 meters; so if you
managed to use them, they would absorb only about 0.3% of the
sunlight, or 1.5kW, so you could use about 30× less of them, by
circumference, than of some cheaper material.  However, they cost a
lot more than 30× as much, they're a lot trickier to connect, and
they'd need complicated light-gathering and great care taken with the
highly concentrated sunlight within them, so it wouldn't be worth it
except perhaps for special applications, like solar surgery or
welding.

[32]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber_cable#Losses

[Ocean water attenuates at about 10dB/75m][24] or 5dB/40m, despite its
particulate content, so transparent pipes full of pure water might
work fine as light pipes for this purpose if you don't bend them too
sharply, as long as the pipe material's refractive index isn't too
much higher than the water's.  (On the other hand,
[other published attenuation coefficients for seawater][25] point at
more like 10dB/40m in even the clearest waters; apparently it depends
on the wavelength range you
consider. [Some book on the Chesapeake Bay][26] says, "Lorenzen (1972)
estimated the attenuation due to water alone to be 0.038 m⁻¹, though
his measurements were for deep ocean conditions, in which measurements
generally commence at depths > 5 meters."; this works out to be
0.17dB/m, or 6.7dB/40m.  [Pope and Fry's 1997 measurements][27] find
absorption coefficients varying by wavelength from 0.00442/m at
417.5nm, which they point out is "more than a factor of 3 lower than
previously accepted values...unquestionably a result of contamination
by [the other experimenters'] stainless steel cell", up to 1.678/m at
727nm; I don't even know how to interpret an absorption
coefficient >1, but if the other one meant what I thought it did, it's 0.019dB/m
or 0.77dB/40m, which is quite acceptable.  If too much of your light
at depth were blue, you could use fluorescence to reconvert some of it
to yellow; I used to have a dark green plastic bottle that fluoresced
bright yellow in the light of my blue LED, but wouldn't fluoresce in
ultraviolet light at all.)

Fiber optics have the advantage that you can "switch" them by filling
junctions with liquid water, which allows light to flow instead of
suffering total internal reflection.

I don't know if you can get reasonably cheap glass, acrylic, or
polycarbonate of sufficient clarity.  Apparently Toshikuni Kaino et
al. (Applied Physics Letters 41, 802 (1982)) describes an acrylic
(PMMA) plastic with a 50dB/km loss, which would be ample.  Apparently
this is [what is now known as "POF"][33], is widely available, and
[costs US$0.25/m][34] in 1mm inner fiber diameter, but that stuff has
unacceptably high losses of up to 200dB/km; so I suspect the answer is
no.

[33]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plastic_optical_fiber
[34]: http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/512498068/Data_transmission_1_0_2_2mm.html

Alternatively, you might be able to use an air-filled pipe lined with
aluminum, aluminized mylar, silver, or gold, to a thickness of a few
dozen atoms.  The trouble is that you lose energy on every reflection.
Aluminum is only, at best, [about 92% reflective][28] in the visible,
so you lose 0.36dB per bounce, while [gold reaches 97% in the
red][29], thus losing only 0.13dB, but absorbs a lot of blue and even
yellow light.  [Silver nearly hits 97% across the visible][30].  With
sufficiently wide light pipes, say bigger than 50cm, these could maybe
perform better than fiber-optic light pipes full of water.

##### What to do with light in the depths: luminaires #####

The actual luminaires illuminated by that the sunlight delivered
through the lightguides can be of almost any form.  You can illuminate
the water in an indoor fountain or pool, a crystalline object such as
a large salt crystal, or anything made of frosted glass.  A planar
lightguide made of glass could even out the illumination over a large
surface made of something like marble bonded to it.  Or you could
backlight a water-cooled LCD display as a sort of virtual window.

Fluorescence and filters (dichroic or otherwise) can be used to alter
the colors of the lighting.

##### Dimmer lighting with lightguides #####

You might prefer to have dimmer lighting some of the time, even during
the day; for example, many computer screens are more readable in dim
light.  Direct sunlight, like sunbathing on the beach, is around
100k[lux][35]; full daylight out of the sun is around 15klux; a cloudy
day is around 1klux; a typical office is around 400 lux; a typical
living room at night is around 50 lux; you can see when things are
illuminated with around a millilux; and you can see light sources down
to a few nanolux.

[35]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux

Accordingly, if you choose to light your office like a typical office
during the day, instead of using 4m² of skylight for yourself, you'll
only be using 0.04m², leaving more for other arcologists.

##### Fallback lighting with LEDs and fluorescents #####

You can, of course, use electricity to get lighting at night or when
you want more light than is available from the sun.  The best LEDs are
around 200 lumens per watt, and a lux is a lumen per square meter, so
to reach 15klux with those you'd need 75 watts per square meter, and
about US$75 per square meter.  Fluorescent lights are a little lower
in efficiency, but also in cost.

10.4 kilowatts is enough energy to run quite a lot of incandescent
lights, too, but you probably want to avoid doing much of that, just
because it will contribute undesirably to heating, adding extra heat
that needs to be removed.

##### Underground rain-forest gardening #####

One of the key features of historical luxury homes has been their
gardens.  But, aside from the park at the surface, it might seem that
we don't have sufficient lighting to maintain hundreds of square
meters of lush gardens per person; after all, to preserve the surface,
we're only letting a small fraction of the sunlight into the arcology.

But, if our purpose is lush vegetation rather than high agricultural
productivity, a small fraction is plenty.

_Photosynthesis and productivity in different environments, vol. 3_,
(ed. John Philip Cooper), has on p. 20 a graph of "relative
illuminance", showing that on the floor of an evergreen oak forest,
illuminance was only some 5% of full sunlight, while in the ten meters
above the floor of a tropical rain forest, illuminance never exceeded
2% of full sunlight, only reaching 5% at some 20 meters; at the forest
floor it was more like 0.5%.  (He also provided absolute numbers for 
PAR, or "photosynthetically active radiation": 5-50
"cal cm⁻² d⁻¹", which I suppose is cal/cm²/day; these non-SI units,
sadly, are ambiguous, as there are two separate units of energy known
as the calorie, which differ by three orders of magnitude).
_Tarsiers: past, present, and future_, (ed. Wright, Simons, and
Gursky) cites "Grubb and Whitmore, 1967" for the observation (p. 39):

> At the forest floor, rain forests have low relative illuminance of
> visible light, often less than 1%.

[Frances Baines, in the Daintree ancient tropical lowland rainforest
in Queensland][50], measured 2klux in the shade, where she was
examining ultraviolet illuminance on reptiles, compared to 90klux "in
the sunlit area".  She notes, however:

> It is interesting to note the wide range of temperatures, light
> levels and UVB light levels available on the forest floor - all
> within feet of each other, and constantly changing as the sunlight
> moves through the canopy above.

[50]: http://www.reptileuvinfo.com/html/uv-light-in-daintree-rainforest-northern-queensland.htm

This is consistent with some 2% average illuminance.

So, plants adapted to life in forests below the canopy could be
gardened productively with minimal amounts of light, if its spectral
composition isn't too far off.  Every square meter of light captured
at the surface could be distributed to feed 50 or 100 square meters of
underground gardens simulating a rain-forest understory, with its
ferns, mosses, shrubs, insects, and reptiles.

You'll probably need substantial ultraviolet, though, so soda-lime
glass and water won't cut it as light-pipe materials.

#### Exhausting CO₂ ####

People and fires produce [carbon dioxide][36], which acidifies your
blood, makes your lungs feel like you're suffocating, and would
eventually replace all the oxygen in your air and suffocate you.  But
for plants, CO₂ is an essential nutrient, which they struggle mightily
to extract from the air; normal air is only 0.039% CO₂ (up from 0.032%
CO₂ in 1960).  If you feed them air with 0.1% CO₂, they can grow 50%
faster and produce 12% higher yields.  You can deal with sustained
breathing of air with 1% or 2% CO₂, but normally you want to try to
keep it to 0.2% or so.  Your own exhalation is about 5% CO₂, totaling
about 1kg/day (12mg/s); 1% CO₂ is enough to kill some insect pests.

[36]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2#Human_physiology

Also, in some places, CO₂ will seep out of the ground, and you need to
ventilate spaces fast enough to keep it from building up.  This is
particularly tough underground, because CO₂'s molecular mass of 44 is
much higher than the molecular masses of nitrogen and oxygen (30
and 32). It's so much denser
that you aren't going to be able to do it with convection at
any kind of safe temperature.  You have to do it with chemicals or
air pumps.

Compost also produces CO₂.

So you'd ideally want to route a lot of CO₂-rich air to surface
greenhouses, both to reduce the CO₂ emissions of the arcology and to
promote the productivity of its crops, ultimately using nearly all of
the produced CO₂ (average 1.4g/s across all 125 people, not counting
sources other than respiration) into the biomass in the greenhouse.
But that turns out not to be possible, as explained below.

The numbers above suggest that you need to change the air in a room
after you've breathed at most a twenty-fifth of it.  If the room is
3m×3m×6m, it contains about 54m² and 54kg of air, and it needs to be
replaced every time you emit 0.2% × 54kg = 108g CO₂, which at 12mg/s,
is 150 minutes — an air change every two and a half hours.  However,
as shown below, other considerations require an air change several
times more often than that!

Nuclear submarines and space stations sometimes have "scrubbers"
consisting of metal oxides (CaO, LiO) which absorb CO₂ from the air,
producing carbonates; and houseplants can also absorb CO₂.  These
might be useful for resiliency purposes, but they probably aren't
necessary for day-to-day living.

#### Clean air ####

It's necessary to replace the air in a room several times an hour to
keep it habitable, due to accumulation of other things than CO₂:
humidity, bad smells, dust, and heat. [A list of uncertain
provenance][37] gives numbers that range from two air changes per hour
(that is, 2m³ of air per m³ of room volume per hour) for a warehouse,
up to 15–60 for kitchens, or 20–30 for spaces like bars, taverns,
clubhouses, and repair garages.

[37]: http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/air-change-rate-room-d_867.html

(Dust, aside from being potentially allergenic, can also be
explosive.)

This suggests that, for luxury, you need at least 10 air changes per
hour in the rooms where you are, and more if there's a crowd or things
are on fire; and at least 4 air changes per hour in the rooms where you
aren't, which will be the vast majority of the arcology and therefore
dominates the total ventilation need.

If you figure that all of this air needs to come from the outdoors,
which seems like a conservative but perhaps not unreasonable
assumption, that's the full 3200m³/人 of air, every 15 minutes
(≈1mHz), or roughly 3.2m³/人/s, or 400m³/s across the whole arcology.
In the non-SI units usually used for HVAC work in the US, that's
850 000 cfm, which is a fucking hell of a lot of air, all of which has
to go through highly-efficient heat exchangers to prevent excessive
heat loss.  That's not hard to do, since you can easily lay hundreds of
meters of ducts, but it's something to keep in mind.

The [Passive House guidelines][38] require not exceeding 30m³/人/hour,
which means 0.008m³/人/s, "to avoid overly dry air", because
"humidifying the air within the ventilation system is to be avoided
for reasons of hygiene".  You're obviously going to be violating the
crap out of both of these recommendations, along with most of the rest
of the Passivhaus program, because although it's awesome, it's
designed for ordinary buildings, not underground cities.

[38]: http://www.passivehouse-international.org/index.php?page_id=80

Changing the air so often means your breath will be useless for
feeding plants unless you concentrate it further, but whatever.

##### Ventilation power #####

A [small US$80 six-inch fan][39] does 400CFM, which is to say,
0.2m³/s.  You need sixteen thousand times that, which would, linearly
extrapolating, cost US$1.3 million of fans.

[39]: http://www.amazon.com/Hydrofarm-Active-Air-inch-In-Line/dp/B002JQ14F8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1366192815&sr=8-1&keywords=cfm

More digging around suggests that [you can order custom-built 3.5PSIG
50 000CFM blowers][40], of which you'd need 17, but if you have to ask,
you can't afford one.  At 3.5 PSIG, which is to say 24 kPa difference
input to output, each of these would be outputting 570 kW, for a total
of 10MW, or 77kW/人 — way outside our energy budget, even before
factoring in motor losses!

[40]: http://www.spencerturbine.com/products/blowers/single-stage-fabricated-centrifugal-blowers/default.html

That means that if you really want to do 400m³/s, you need to do it at
more like 1kPa, not 24 kPa.  A [table of duct sizes][41] suggests that
for 50 000 cfm (24m³/s), you should use a 41" (104cm) round duct, which
will have a frictional loss of 0.67 inches water (160 Pa) per 100'
(30.5 m).

[41]: http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/equivalent-diameter-d_443.html

If you used 17 such ducts for 40 meters of input and 17 more for an
equivalent distance of output (a combined total of 104cm * π * 80m =
4400m² of galvanized sheet metal), then you'd have 426 Pa of pressure
dropped in those ducts, for "only" 171kW.  That gets us down to just
over 1kW per person, which is manageable but still seems high.
Despite the chances of infiltration by movie villains, it seems like
it might be worthwhile to use still larger ducts in order to further
reduce the energy usage, noise, and surface winds; and perhaps very
wide, flat ones, so you can make them work effectively as heat
exchangers.  (They have to be wide way out of proportion to their
flatness.)

#### Garbage ####

The traditional approach to garbage in big apartment buildings was the
garbage chute: a nearly-vertical shaft with a door on each level into
which you would dump your garbage bags, emptying into a bin in the
basement.  This seems to have gone out of style; XXX I don't know why.

The approach taken in the apartment buildings I've lived in in Buenos
Aires in the last few years is, instead, either for each inhabitant to
carry their garbage separately to the curb for pickup, or (especially
in larger buildings) to have a garbage can on each level, which the
building caretaker empties each day, typically dirtying up the freight
elevator.

Garbage in general is a pretty big problem for would-be
self-sufficient communities; simply stated, a group that generates
garbage is not really self-sufficient.  The universe has no garbage,
only recycling.  But full recycling in a modern society is quite
difficult, and probably requires a group much bigger than 125 people.

Nevertheless, we can make substantial improvements over the typical
state of modern urban life, within the scale of this single modest
building.

[A 2008 New York State study][42] found the following composition of
the garbage of the residential and commercial/institutional sector:

[42]: http://www.dec.ny.gov/chemical/65541.html

    | paper              | 33% |
    | glass              |  4% |
    | plastics           | 14% |
    | metal              |  7% |
    | "organics" (food?) | 23% |
    | textiles           |  5% |
    | wood               |  3% |
    | other              | 11% |

The total is 18.3 million tons; if the state contained 19 million
people, that's one ton per person per year, or 28mg/s/人.  With that
in mind:

    |                    |     | mg/s/人 |
    | paper              | 33% | 9       |
    | glass              |  4% | 1.1     |
    | plastics           | 14% | 3.9     |
    | metal              |  7% | 1.9     |
    | "organics" (food?) | 23% | 6.4     |
    | textiles           |  5% | 1.4     |
    | wood               |  3% | 0.8     |
    | other              | 11% | 3.0     |

Of these, paper, wood, textiles, and "organics" can all be composted
for fertilizer, a process which dramatically reduces its mass over the
course of some six months to two years.  Plastics can be recycled into
other plastic (especially if PET), melted into structural material, or
burned for energy and CO₂ for the greenhouses.  Metal and glass can be
profitably sold outside the arcology for scrap, or recycled within.
This leaves only "other", much of which could also be used for
structural material; but if not, we're left with 3mg/s/人 of dumpit,
375mg/s in total, or almost 12 tonnes per year for the arcology as a
whole, perhaps 6m³.

Since this "other" contains nothing that could plausibly rot, and
hopefully nothing that's chemically unstable, it doesn't need to be
taken out immediately.  You could quite reasonably take out the
arcology's garbage once a month instead of once a day, to keep it from
piling up; or if you decided you had to let it pile up, you would have
enough space to pile it up inside the arcology for 68 millennia.
Given the likely future strategic value of material resources in
garbage, this is probably a good idea.

In my book, that essentially removes garbage as a problem for
self-sufficiency, as long as composting can be made to work, which
turns out to be pretty easy.

##### Composting garbage #####

From the above, we get an estimate of 64% of garbage as compostable, a
total of 18mg/s/人, or 2.2g/s.  Of this, some 6.4mg/s/人 is "organic",
which presumably means "wet"; that probably shrinks by some 75% if you
dry it out, which you probably want to do before you compost it,
reducing it to 1.6mg/s/人, and reducing the total to 13mg/s/人 or
1.6g/s.

This compost, if managed as "hot" compost and watered and turned
properly, takes some 1-3 months before it's ready for use as
fertilizer.  If you take the high end of that range, 3 months, you can
see that you have some 13 tons of compost (say, 13 m³), plus water,
constantly fermenting.  This is an eminently, almost trivially
manageable quantity, and it will diminish further once I get to
discussing sewage, since much of this compost will be diverted to
sewage treatment.

This is, however, a size of compost heap that will benefit from a
mechanical compost tumbler, regular temperature and humidity checks,
and XXX

#### Food ####

As I mentioned before, you, individually, need to eat 100–120W or
5–6mg/s of carbohydrate and protein to survive.  

##### Soy: not enough of a miracle, needs 1000m²/人 #####

Soy, one of the highest-yielding crops, yields on average about 45
bushels/acre/year (12 picometers per second), and each bushel yields
11 pounds (5kg, 141 g/l) of oil and 48 pounds (22 kg, 620 g/l) of
meal, which is about 80% carbohydrate and protein. 620 g/l * 12 pm/s *
80% = 6.1 micrograms/m²/s, which means you need about 1000m² of soy to
feed you, a quarter of an acre.  Not much!

Well, that's unfortunate, because you only have 80m², and that has to
include your solar panels and skylights too.  You're too low by a
factor of about 12.

##### Sugarcane #####

Sugarcane is one of the most energy-efficient crops.  Experimental
small plots in Brazil, says WP, have yielded 250 tonnes/hectare/year
(25 kg/m²/year, or 790 micrograms/m²/s).  Suppose you can raise it in
greenhouses with enriched CO₂ and fertilization and everything; how
much can it feed you?  Suppose, like [Louisiana's farmers in
2011][46], you get 230 pounds of raw sugar per ton of cane, 11.5%, and
suppose that's basically 100% carbohydrate.  That's 91
micrograms/m^2/s, which is 15 times better than soy!  You're saved!
Barely!

But, well, you do need some protein.  And 25 kg/m²/year is way beyond
normal; normal is 7.  Those Louisiana farmers were delighted to get
9.6.  25 was the NPK-fertilized trial in Brazil reported in Bogdan's
1977 _Tropical pasture and fodder plants_, and it's anyone's guess
whether you can really reproduce that.

How can it be that 80m² provides 10kW of XXX oh, of energy, not of
electricity.

##### Fungus #####

You may be able to supplement your diet with fungus.  Quorn, for
example, is made from the hyphae of the _Fusarium venenatum_ soil
mold, processed to remove RNA and DNA.

#### Ingress and Egress ####

Somewhat to my surprise, it appears that it's actually possible for an
arcology to comply with, say, [the Pennsylvania fire code][43],
because the fire code doesn't actually require you to be able to get
out of a building in a reasonable time; it just requires you to be
able to get to the other side of a firewall (an "exit") in a
reasonable time, and from there to outside the building (an "exit
discharge").

[43]: http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/034/chapter50/chap50toc.html

The fire code's guidelines on number and width of doors seem
reasonable:

- at least two exits (four would be better);
- at least 28 inches (71cm) width for each exit; probably 2m is better.
- "exits shall be so arranged that the total length of travel from any
  point to reach an exit will not exceed 150 feet (45 m)", or 200 feet
  (60 m) if sprinklers installed.
- "The capacity in number of persons per unit of width for approved
  components of means of egress shall be 60 persons. Buildings
  protected by automatic sprinkler systems shall be allowed 90 persons
  per unit of width;" here a unit of width is basically the 71cm
  mentioned earlier.  For 125 people, then, two exits is almost
  sufficient, and two double-wide exits is quite sufficient.
- maximum slope of an exit ramp: 8.33%.  Unfortunately this would
  demand that you run almost 500m to get up and out of the pit
  arcology using the ramp.

The fire-code occupancy guidelines for housing occupancy is to assume
at least one occupant per 125 square feet (11.6m²) of bedroom.  If
each person did actually dedicate a quarter of their 800m² to
bedrooms, you'd end up with 200m² of bedroom per person, with the
rather absurd result that you'd need to build means of egress for some
17 times the sustainable occupant load of the arcology — almost 2200
people.  That means you'd need 36 "units of width" on the exit
stairways.  The "units of width" measure is a little bit nonlinear,
and it turns out that, with four exit stairways, you could manage it
if each one were 4.6 meters wide.  Four stairways of 4.6 meters wide,
by themselves, should be no problem.  However, should someone decide
to set up a classroom or dining area or something in one of their
rooms — something with fewer square feet per person — they could
easily exceed the 2200-people "occupancy" limit!

Certainly, exits sufficient for emergency use by thousands of people
should be adequate for regular use by 125 people.

Moving-sidewalk ramps carrying you rapidly up from the lower stories
to near the surface, in the case of the below-grade arcology, would
seem to be a good idea.

#### Water ####

A bacteriostatic water tank at the top of the arcology, filled with
chlorinated water, can provide on-demand pressurized clean cold-water
supplies to all residents.

Where do you get the water?  Well, maybe you can use a municipal water
supply, but that's not very self-sufficient.  You can use a well, if
you're in a zone where the groundwater is safe and abundant.  Or you
can harvest rainwater or moisture from the air.

As mentioned later, the usual Burning Man figure is that you need
about 8 ℓ/人/day, or 93 microliters/人/s.  Spread over 80m²/人, that's
1.16 nm/s of rain you need, or in the non-SI units typically used by
meteorologists, 37 mm/year or 1.43 inches/year.  [There *are* parts of
the world that get less than that][44]: much of the Sahara and the
Atacama, and small parts of Arabia, the Australian Outback, Nevada,
Greenland, and Siberia, and presumably Antarctica; but *most* of the
Sahara, of Arabia, of the Gobi, and so on, get more rain than that.

[44]: http://www.climate-charts.com/World-Climate-Maps.html#rain

But suppose you don't?  Suppose you're in the middle of the Sahara?
You have to condense water out of the air, either using a thermal
store (radiate away heat at night and store the cold in a water tank,
then use the cold water to condense more water on the surface of a
pipe, warming up the cold water until the next night) or, in the worst
case, using an electrical heat pump, aka an air conditioner.  The
electrical heat pump needs to be able to lower the temperature of the
air to its dewpoint, at which point its coefficient of performance is
probably closer to 1 than the usual 2 — it's burning 1 J for every J
of heat that it manages to pump away from its cold side.  [Condensing
water takes] about 2.26 MJ/ℓ; at 93μℓ/人/s, that's 210W/人, an easily
payable energy cost.

So you can totally build a viable arcology in the middle of the
Sahara, just as long as the Tuaregs are cool with it.

## Stored supplies for resiliency ##

It seems inevitable that some of the people attracted to such a
community will be interested in resiliency against external shocks,
such as terrorist attacks, economic collapse, or military occupation.
So it might be worthwhile to investigate how much storage space you
need for emergency supplies.

### A year's worth of water: 2.9m³/人, 360m³ total ###

Of all the groups who store up for emergencies, the Mormons are the
most extreme; they are [recommended to keep three months' worth of food on
hand][10], and normally a year's worth.  Of all the supplies you need,
oxygen is the bulkiest, but for the time being, let's exclude the
emergencies that require you to use stored oxygen!  Water is next.
How much water do you need?

[10]: http://www.lds.org/topics/food-storage

At Burning Man, in the desert, you needed about 8 liters of water per
person per day.  A year's worth, then, is 2.9m³/人, which is an almost
insignificant fraction of the 3200m³/人 we're talking about.  You
could probably get by with less, since arcology air isn't desert air,
but why bother?

If you had a centralized water tank with storage for the whole
arcology, you'd need only 360m³, which is about 7 m in diameter.
While this would provide great resiliency against external supply
disruptions, it would only provide limited resiliency against internal
prisoner's-dilemma problems; see "Community issues" below.  A
centralized water tank can also provide gravity-feed water pressure
for the majority of the arcology, as described above under "Utilities".

## Community issues ##

As anyone who's attended a condo association meeting knows,
cooperating with your neighbors can be by far the hardest part of
living in a community.  And the more common resources you share, and
the less trusting your neighbors are, the harder this is.

So it seems that the problem of growing a community to create the
arcology is likely to be at least as difficult as the physical
architecture; you could say that's what sunk Arcosanti.

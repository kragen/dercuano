Thinking about underground construction: could you fire individual
rooms out of porcelain (or salt-fired terra-cotta, if you can somehow
detoxify the fumes?) and join them together with silicone caulk/
gaskets to prevent leakage?  The water table is high enough here that
any hole in the ground becomes a well.  For a sufficiently high
budget, of course, you can just carve a chunk of granite or basalt out
of a mountain, carve rooms into it, and bury it with a little bit
sticking out; it will be waterproof, but that fabrication technique is
costly!  The question is how to get waterproof underground
construction at a reasonable cost.

The traditional approach is to build things out of concrete and then
pump the water from the inevitable leaks back upstairs.

You could probably use the traditional approach but seal the entire
outside with tar or pitch, like an old wooden sailing ship, but that
will probably only last a few decades.

If you have a conductive mesh shell around your construction, you
could use it to electrolyze the groundwater to deposit minerals
encasing your construction.  They will preferentially deposit inside
cracks that are filled with water thus sealing the cracks.  This will
only work if you have enough minerals dissolved in the groundwater.
In a sense it’s similar to the pumping approach, in that it will fail
if you have a sustained power outage, but over a much longer
timescale: months or years rather than days.

Another possibility would be to seal the entire construction with some
kind of flexible barrier, like latex rubber or silicone.  Latex will
break down spontaneously over decades and maybe biologically over
years; I think silicone should be stable over a century timescale, but
it is of course more expensive.

Polyethylene might be the ideal material for such a membrane, though.
It’s even more chemically stable than silicone, it’s biologically
stable (though less so than silicone, probably:

even though silicones can be biodegraded

<http://aem.asm.org/content/65/5/2276.full>), it’s cheap as shit, it’s
plastic so that it can handle subsidence without cracking, and it’s a
lot stronger than silicone.  If you have a 1mm LDPE or LLDPE layer in
your walls, that seems like it should be plenty to keep your walls
from ever leaking, at 0.94 kg/m² and €1300/tonne, that’s about
€1.26/m².

This is apparently called a “geomembrane”, and it’s usually used for
landfill liners to keep stuff *in* rather than to keep stuff *out*.
HDPE geomembranes (actually MDPE with filler (typically carbon black)
and antioxidants) ship in 6–9 meter width rolls of 1–2.5mm thickness,
which are then thermally welded together onsite to form the landfill
liner.  Where I live, I can buy 5-meter-wide 1mm HDPE geomembrane for
US$4.21/m² from some guy named Pedro Bernaldez up in Salta:

(A minimal living space of 16m³ might be something like a cylinder of
2m height and 3.19m diameter: 20.04m² of walls, 8m² of ceiling, 8m² of
floor, figure really more like 10m² each of ceiling and floor what
with cutting waste, total of 40m²: US$170 of geomembrane.  This would
involve 20 meters of seams, plus whatever’s needed to get people and
air in and out.)

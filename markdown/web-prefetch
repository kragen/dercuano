I saw this article: “Ludicrously Fast Page Loads - A Guide for
Full-Stack Devs” <https://lobste.rs/s/mj7w3d> and I thought, ‘I wonder
what counts as “ludicrously fast”?  It turns out the article never
actually explains what he means by “ludicrously fast” except that it
should be less than 5 or 10 seconds, but it still seemed like a
thought-provoking question.

I’d like to get below 10ms, so that even at 100fps it’s never more
than a screen refresh away.  On this shitty DSL, even pinging other
people on the same /24 as me takes 50ms, so basically nothing outside
my house is under 10ms.  So we have to prefetch.

(The article has good points on how to reduce your page rendering
times, but I despair of getting HTML5 and CSS to under 10ms.  By
contrast, some simpler layout models can get much faster indeed.)

unavoidably involves push, but my internet connection is currently
about 2.4 megabits per second, and I can only read
                 about 70 bits per second, so the push selection algorithm could have an 0.003% hit rate (i.e. 0.003% of what it downloads is something I actually choose to 
                 look at) and still be useful
